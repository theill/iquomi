			&nbsp;To-do's</h3>
		<p><strong>General</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				we need to add a small <EM>lock</EM> key in lower right of Iquomi client 
				statusbar since this is known by users to mean <EM>secured</EM>
			.
			<li>
				encoding issue on the server side; it needs to retrieve the data as utf-8 and <em>avoid
				</em>
			doing any conversion on them afterwards.
			<li>
			create customized layout of main window.
			<li>
				entire application should support localization using the new interface provided 
				with .NET.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<div class="service">		
			API
        </div>
        <div class="service">
		<ul>
			<li>
			add "ToolbarIcon" for reading a customized icon to be placed on the toolbar.
			<li>
			need events for "OnDataSynchronized", "OnDataReceived", "OnDataSent", 
			"OnlineStatusChanged".
			<li>
			a service must be able to request a window size change of the parent 
			application. this is done in order to fit its content better in the window. An 
			option must be enabled in a configuration file so it's possible to disable this 
			resize from a user-perspective.
			<li>
			Take a look at http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/support/sdkmanual.php for a pretty good 
			overview of messages.<li>
				each service must be able to get localized messages in a common way. maybe we 
				are able to put the localization into the respective services if .NET already 
				gives the user some nice classes. I don't think we need to provide a global or 
				centralized repository in which each service needs to register itself. </li>
		</ul>

		<div class="service">		
			<b>Notes</b> service
			<ul>
			<li>
				add <strong>type</strong>
			field for Note class; this should contain information such as 'registration', 
			'personal', etc
			<li>
			search field should be incremental so it's possible to go through all notes; if 
			found in description which isn't displayed (we only display two or three lines 
			of each note) that specific note should be expanded
			<li>
			support for drag&amp;drop of text-snippets
			<li>
			when drawing elements only selected item will get ellipsed - bug
			<li>
				figure out how to get a XmlDocument from a DataSet since we need this when 
				calling NotifyXXX methods</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
		
		<div class="service">		
			<b>Favorites</b> service
			<ul>
				<li>				there's a problem with "FileSystemWatcher". It is case-insensitive which makes 
				it impossible to detect changes for a given file. A solution might be to do a 
				md5 on the folder + file (exclude full-path to "Favorites" system folder) then 
				use this unique id as an id on the uploaded bookmarks. when a change is made we 
				could generate the md5 again and find the key rather fast.</li>
