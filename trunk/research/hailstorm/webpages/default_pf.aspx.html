      This function builds the numbering scheme for multipage features.
      It takes 2 parameters:
      
      currentPage  the page you are currently on (will not have a link)
      totalPages   the total number of pages in this feature

					<p class="FeatureHead">A Journey Through .Net My Services<br>
<span class="FeatureDek">Use the SDK for Microsoft's new Web services architecture 
to let users access data from any system
</span><br>
<span class="AboutAuthor"><em>by Dale Michalk</em></span></p>

<p><span class="DropCap">T</span>he next big thing in the continuously
changing landscape of distributed technologies is the growth of Web
services. The hypertext transport protocol (HTTP), the universal
data-transfer syntax of XML, and the messaging structure of the Simple
Object Access Protocol (SOAP) enable programmers to leverage the
capabilities of remote network applications quickly and effortlessly
regardless of platform or vendor. This scenario can work across the
Internet for, say, tax calculation or across an intranet to a disparate
line of business applications. The possibility of integrating a myriad
of devices and systems is almost limitless.
</p><p>Microsoft is building a unique Web service architecture around
identity-centric information that takes advantage of the universal
access and reach of the Web service protocols. Data, instead of being
inaccessible in individual PCs, Web sites, or mobile devices, is
available to any system that can authenticate with .Net Passport and
communicate with a Web service. The convenience factor for end users is
high with this type of environment: they no longer have to remember
which password goes with which Web site or e-mail system, and they can
get data they need even if all they have on hand is a cell phone.
Instead of the user conforming to the needs of devices, the devices
become part of one cohesive system at the service of the user. </p>
<p>Microsoft christened this architecture (initially known by the code
name HailStorm) .Net My Services to reflect its user-centric nature.
The first public view of the technology was an alpha software
development kit (SDK) released to the public at the Microsoft
Professional Developer's Conference (PDC) in October 2001. Let's look
at the technology as of the PDC release; expect changes in the service
offerings and technical details by the time you read this.</p>
<p>As an example of .Net My Services in action, imagine a scenario with a user browsing an auction Web site (see <a href="javascript:openWindow6();">Figure 1</a>).
The first step in browsing a Web site participating in the .Net My
Services cloud is authentication with the .Net Passport service. .Net
Passport provides a single sign-on service that allows the user to use
the same login information with multiple participating Web sites in a
secure manner. All the data stored in .Net My Services correlates to
the Passport User ID (PUID) of the customer. Gone are the days of using
the same username/password pair for each site. You sign in once, and
all the services on the network are available to you in a seamless,
secure environment.</p>

<table width="227" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" align="right"><tbody><tr><td width="12" rowspan="2" bgcolor="#ffffff">&nbsp;</td><td><a href="javascript:openWindow6();">
<img src="default_pf.aspx_files/dm0203XML_f1_t.gif" width="215" height="132" alt="" border="0">
</a></td></tr>
<tr><td class="figtable"><span class="FigureCap">Figure 1.</span>  Browsing with .Net My Services<a class="FigureCap" href="javascript:openWindow6();"> Click here</a>.</td></tr></tbody></table>


<p>Once authenticated and browsing items are up for auction, the user
decides to place a bid for a lava lamp. The auction Web site provides
the means for the user to opt into changes to his or her personal
calendar on the .Net Calendar service and post the span of days for the
auction. The user can also choose to have his or her MSN Messenger
instant messaging client notified by the .Net Alerts service when the
user is outbid for an item. </p>
<p>When the user finishes with the bid process, he or she types in the
URL of a favorite online bookstore. The user uses .Net Passport to sign
into the online bookstore and begin browsing for a title on programming
with .Net My Services. Once he or she finds the book and begins the
checkout, the user can call up previously entered address information
from his or her .Net Profile service and payment information from .Net
Wallet. As a final part of the checkout, the bookstore sets up the .Net
Alerts service to notify the user with an instant message when the book
has shipped.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, back on the auction site, the auction ends and the Web
site sends an alert to the bidder through the .Net Alerts service. The
user, who now transitions from using a PC to using his or her cell
phone, has communicated that pertinent fact with the .Net Presence
service. .Net My Services is smart enough to route the instant message
to the cell phone service provider gateway instead of the PC with the
MSN Messenger client used before (see <a href="javascript:openWindow7();">Figure 2</a>).
The smart cell phone also has an integrated Web browser, so the user
can go back to the auction site on the phone and complete the payment
process using the .Net Profile and .Net Wallet services. The user
doesn't need to go back to the PC to get the address and payment
information, because it's stored in the .Net My Services cloud to make
it securely and easily available from any device.</p>

<tr><td class="figtable"><span class="FigureCap">Figure 2.</span>  Accessing Services from a Cell Phone<a class="FigureCap" href="javascript:openWindow7();"> Click here</a>.</td></tr></tbody></table>


<p>This simple example gives you but a glimpse of the services .Net My Services makes possible. See  the <a href="javascript:openWindow9();">Planned .Net My Services Web Services table</a> for more detail on each service slated for completion in the first release of .Net My Services.</p>

<p><span class="SubHead">Web Services Paradigms</span><br>
Now that you've seen a view of the .Net My Services architecture from a
customer standpoint, I'll drill down into the technology from a
programmer's point of view. To provide context for the journey, I'll
start by reviewing how to build a typical Web service with a modern Web
service toolkit. </p>
<p>Web service frameworks such as the SOAP Toolkit and Visual Studio
.Net make it easy to take an existing object and generate a compatible
SOAP messaging system. They abstract the details of XML serialization
and SOAP message construction through code generators and support
classes to make the service invocation look like a normal procedure
call. The focus of the programming is on the method called and the
business logic executed. This code is the corresponding client for the
prototypical stock quote Web service (see <a href="javascript:openWindow1();">Listing 1</a>) that consumes this Web service's functionality using the .Net framework and C#:</p>

<pre class="snippet">using System;
namespace XMLMagHSConsoleClient
{
class StockTickerClient
{
	[STAThread]
	static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		localticker.StockTicker 
			tickersvc = new
			localticker.StockTicker();
		decimal price = 
			tickersvc.GetStockPrice(
			args[0]);

	Console.WriteLine(
		"Symbol:" + args[0]);
	Console.WriteLine(
		"Price:" + price.ToString(
		"C"));
	}
}
}</pre>


<p>The Web service client SOAP request looks like this:</p>

<pre class="snippet">&lt;?xml version=
	"1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt; 
&lt;soap:Envelope 
	xmlns:soap=
		"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/
		soap/envelope/" 
	xmlns:xsi=
		"http://www.w3.org/2001/
		XMLSchema-instance" 
	xmlns:xsd=
		"http://www.w3.org/2001/
		XMLSchema"&gt;
&lt;soap:Body&gt;
	&lt;GetStockPrice xmlns=
		"http://hailstormcoder.com/"&gt;
		&lt;symbol&gt;MSFT&lt;/symbol&gt; 
	&lt;/GetStockPrice&gt;
&lt;/soap:Body&gt;
&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;</pre>

<p>and the Web service SOAP response looks like this:</p>

<pre class="snippet">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding=
	"utf-8" ?&gt; 
&lt;soap:Envelope 
	xmlns:soap=
		"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/
		soap/envelope/" 
	xmlns:xsi=
		"http://www.w3.org/2001/
		XMLSchema-instance" 
	xmlns:xsd=
		"http://www.w3.org/2001/
		XMLSchema"&gt;
&lt;soap:Body&gt;
	&lt;GetStockPriceResponse xmlns=
		"http://tempuri.org/"&gt;
		&lt;GetStockPriceResult&gt;63
		&lt;/GetStockPriceResult&gt; 
	&lt;/GetStockPriceResponse&gt;
&lt;/soap:Body&gt;
&lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;</pre>

<p>The XML and SOAP messages are a means to an end: they exist to
communicate typed data between the bodies of code in a transparent
manner. The programmer thinks in terms of objects, not of XML.</p>



<p><span class="SubHead">Document Centricity</span><br>
.Net My Services operates under a different paradigm in the design of
its Web services. Instead of hiding the XML work behind a facade, it
elevates it to first-class status by factoring Web services in a
document-centric manner (see <a href="javascript:openWindow8();">Figure 3</a>). The XML is the service and data is king. </p>
<p>Each .Net My Services Web service is an entry point to a set of
hosted XML documents representing user information keyed to a Passport
User ID. The Passport User ID can represent a customer identity or the
identity of a group of customers. The content document holds the user
data, the roleList document determines who can access and change the
content document, and a system document helps the infrastructure
maintain the service.</p>
<p>To manipulate the XML user data, all services support the common
data access methods that make up the HSDL: query, insert, replace,
delete, and update. In addition, services can expose custom commands to
help work with information that is difficult to describe; an example is
the getFreeBusyDays command of the .Net Calendar service.</p>

<p>The entry point to development with .Net My Services is the .Net My
Services SDK. It provides a host of tools and a sample service
infrastructure to help you work with the technology in a development
environment that mimics the eventual production characteristics. The
toolkit should be publicly available as a downloadable SDK for your
perusal sometime around the time this article hits the shelves. </p>
<p>The .Net My Services SDK installation process creates a directory
structure holding tools and supporting documents, and it sets up a Web
server environment including an Internet Information Server (IIS) Web
application for each service. Each Web service takes on the form of a
set of ISAPI DLLs, installed at the outset with the rest of the SDK,
that translate HSDL commands into the appropriate actions upon a
back-end SQL Server database.</p>
<p>The tool for setting up a service to support an identity is hsprov,
and hspost packages HSDL commands and transmits them to the .Net My
Services infrastructure from a convenient command-line tool. It handles
many tasks that would otherwise be a lot of work for someone testing
and prototyping code with a service: network communication over HTTP,
service-location lookup, user authentication, and SOAP header creation
and message packaging. This hsprov syntax provisions the .Net Profile
service to support the currently logged-in user, creating the necessary
content and roleList documents as a starting point for allowing other
tools to manipulate data:</p>

<pre class="snippet">C:\hsprov -v -s myProfile -l http://
	localhost
myProfile service successfully 
	provisioned</pre>
	

<p>The hspost -p option is interesting because it shows the fake PUID
generated by the SDK to stand in as a placeholder for a full security
ticket or certificate in the future. It's a numeric value generated by
a hash of the identity name. Here hspost -p generates the PUID for my
administrator account: </p>

<pre class="snippet">C:\hspost -p
Your username is Administrator - 
	PUID = 13971</pre>

<p>The next version of the SDK should have full support for a test
environment using Kerberos authentication and allow encryption and
signing of messages.</p>
<p>The SDK provides documentation and code samples on programming with
the test infrastructure. The primary information source is the XMI
manual containing the XML document schema of each service and material
on how to use it effectively, along with a tutorial on HSDL. The code
examples in the SDK show several ways to communicate with different
types of clients, both managed and unmanaged. We begin our tour using
the hspost tool to work through the basic concepts of HSDL.</p>

<p><span class="SubHead">Inserting into .Net Profile</span><br>
.Net My Services Web services all start with blank documents after
provisioning and need user data to make them interesting. As a first
example, I instruct hspost to insert name and e-mail information into
the .Net Profile service: </p>

<pre class="snippet">&lt;hs:insertRequest 
	xmlns:hs=
		"http://schemas.microsoft.com/
		hs/2001/10/core" 
	xmlns:m=
		"http://schemas.microsoft.com/

&lt;/hs:insertRequest&gt;</pre>

<p>The insert HSDL command takes on the form of an XML element shell
surrounding the content needing insertion. The select attribute of the
insertRequest element specifies the insertion point into the content
document. It can match a single node location or a set of nodes if the
desired outcome is multiple insertions of data. To produce full output
of XML messages in both directions and help the troubleshooting
process, we use the -v option of hspost.</p>
<p>The insertResponse message indicates through the status attribute
that the operation was a success and gives primary key information in
the form of the newBlueId elements (see <a href="javascript:openWindow2();">Listing 2</a>).
The selectedNodeCount indicates the number of nodes matched in the
content document by the select attribute of the insertRequest. </p>


<p>A quick detour is in order to explain what's happening with the
header information in the SOAP messages. The header elements are part
of the Global XML Web Services Architecture (GXA) Microsoft is
proposing as a set of cross-platform, standard, and modular header
extensions to the base SOAP protocol to enhance its functionality
beyond simple message passing. (The word "simple" in the SOAP acronym
is perhaps becoming an oxymoron.)</p>
<p>GXA includes in part WS-Security for credential passing, message
integrity, and message confidentiality; WS-Licenses for carrying
authentication credentials such as Kerberos tickets and X.509
certificates; and WS-Routing for allowing message identification,
flexible routing, multiple transports, and the ability to handle
synchronous or asynchronous communications. </p>
<p>The <a href="javascript:openWindow10();">SOAP header path element</a>
maps to the WS-Routing specification of GXA. The action element has
textual content identifying the role the message plays: request,
response, fault, or notification. This decouples the SOAP message from
a model of synchronous request-response transports or asynchronous
one-way transports. The message is addressed to the URL specified by
the to element. The fwd and rev elements route the document through a
specific path if they are present. The via node lists the stops on the
journey to the final destination inside of the fwd or rev blocks.</p>
<p>In <a href="javascript:openWindow2();">Listing 2</a> the default
forward path is taken because of the absence of a fwd element. The
reverse path piggybacks the Web service response on top of the HTTP
response through a blank via element to the rev element. The final
element in the path header block is the id element, which is used to
identify the message in a unique manner for allowing message
correlation in an asynchronous messaging environment such as SMTP. </p>
<p>The licenses element block forms the core of the WS-Licenses
specification and establishes proof of client authentication through
the presentation of a Kerberos ticket or X.509 certificate. Because
we're using the early version of the SDK, Listing 2 shows the
simplistic hashed username PUID. Expect to see a full-featured
implementation of security-related SOAP messaging in the beta release
of the SDK.</p>
<p>The request element is not a proposed XML specification, but is an
integral way for the .Net My Services infrastructure to process client
requests efficiently. It identifies the service, the type of document,
the HSDL command to invoke, and whether or not a message response is
desired. This feature helps to decouple service invocation from
protocol-specific header mechanisms such as the HTTP header.</p>


<p>Back from our detour examining the SOAP header, I continue the quest
for user data by using the HSDL query command to reveal the fruits of
my insert labor. This document fragment submitted to hspost has an
xpQuery element with a select XPath attribute:</p>

<pre class="snippet">&lt;hs:queryRequest
	xmlns:hs=
		"http://schemas.microsoft.com/
		hs/2001/10/core" 
	xmlns:m=
		"http://schemas.microsoft.com/
		hs/2001/10/myProfile"&gt;
	&lt;hs:xpQuery select=
		"/m:myProfile" /&gt;    
&lt;/hs:queryRequest&gt;</pre>

<p>You can include multiple xpQuery elements under the queryRequest to
select a variety of node sets from different locations in the content
document. </p><p>
</p><p>You can see a truncated result document including the request and response portions of XML content (see <a href="javascript:openWindow3();">Listing 3</a>).
The remaining examples with HSDL will do the same. The response message
confirms the reported success of the insert operation.</p>
<p>Instead of treating the XML documents of a service as large blobs,
.Net My Services partitions the document through a color scheme to make
manipulation efficient and granular to support indexing, caching, and
shredding for storage to a database. Blue nodes are the primary blocks
of a service document and are the primary target of HSDL manipulations.
The XPath selections in the HSDL commands all must anchor their
operations on a blue node. Red attributes exist as adornments in aiding
in the selection of blue elements and are permissible as predicates to
help blue selection in an XPath statement. You can insert a red node,
like a blue node, into a service document, but you must do so in the
context of a blue node. Black nodes are the remaining nodes that don't
fall into either the blue or red node camp. The .Net infrastructure
treats them as opaque content for HSDL processing. <a href="javascript:openWindow4();">Listing 4</a> provides a colorized version of the document received from the query command in <a href="javascript:openWindow3();">Listing 3</a>.</p>
<p>An extra addition is the {any} notation to show the location of
extensibility points built into portions of the service document. This
allows third-party developers to insert content into the content
document as long as it is well-formed, schema-valid content scoped
properly by a namespace. The top-level element and attributes of {any}
content is implicitly red content with child XML content taking on
black colorization. </p>
<p>The use of colorization has an impact of the granularity of nodes
you use when working with documents. The red attributes are hooks to
identity and gather up blues; the id attribute is the primary key used
when multiple nodes exist for an element type. Blue nodes are retrieval
and update boundaries; in the example the email, name, and other child
elements all need to be bundled together any time the emailAddress
address blue is loaded or updated. </p>

<p>The replace command is really two commands rolled into one atomic
operation: a delete followed by an insert. This code illustrates how to
change our emailAddress in the .Net Profile service to my MSN hotmail
address: </p>

<pre class="snippet">&lt;hs:replaceRequest 
	xmlns:hs=
		"http://schemas.microsoft.com/hs/
		2001/10/core" 
	xmlns:m=
		"http://schemas.microsoft.com/
		hs/2001/10/myProfile"
	select="/m:myProfile/
		m:emailAddress[@id=
		"F2D6F211-51BC-4127-8329-
		E9926CA9ED19']" 
	minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"
	&lt;m:emailAddress&gt;
		&lt;m:email&gt;demichalk@hotmail.com
		&lt;/m:email&gt;
		&lt;m:name xml:lang="en-us"&gt;
			Dale Michalk&lt;/m:name&gt;
	&lt;/m:emailAddress&gt;
&lt;/hs:replaceRequest&gt;</pre>

<p>This code shows the hspost output:</p>

<pre class="snippet">&lt;hs:replaceResponse   
	xmlns:hs=
		"http://schemas.microsoft.com/hs/
			2001/10/core" 
	status="success" selectedNodeCount=
		"1"
		newChangeNumber="412"/&gt;</pre>

<p>The output element replaceResponse contains attributes necessary to
figure out the status of the operation. The status attribute is
normally set to success unless we commit an egregious error in
formulating the XPath select. Error conditions generally rise from
poorly formed XML or improper node selection in an XPath statement. We
can augment the error checking by setting up attributes on the
replaceRequest message. We'd set the minOccurs and maxOccurs attributes
equal to one. Had the selectedNodeCount not equaled one, a failure
status would have been generated.</p>


<p>Delete operations are probably the easiest HSDL commands to execute.
Here's how to delete the e-mail address in the .Net Profile service: </p>

<pre class="snippet">&lt;hs:deleteRequest
	xmlns:hs=
		"http://schemas.microsoft.com/hs/
		2001/10/core" 
	xmlns:m=
		"http://schemas.microsoft.com/
		hs/2001/10/myProfile"
	select=
		"/m:myProfile/m:emailAddress"&gt;
&lt;/hs:deleteRequest&gt;</pre>

<p>This XML fragment shows the result of a successful deletion:</p>

<pre class="snippet">&lt;hs:deleteResponse   
	xmlns:hs=
		"http://schemas.microsoft.com/hs/
		2001/10/core" 
	status="success" selectedNodeCount=
		"1" 
		newChangeNumber="412"/&gt;</pre>

<p>The most complicated HSDL command is the update operation. It's not
a separate function of its own, but instead is a container of multiple
operations, analogous to a SQL batch containing multiple SQL
statements. The update command allows the transmission of multiple
insert, update, and delete commands in a single round-trip. </p>
<p>The updateBlock is the main structure inside of an update operation.
It provides a means for packaging and for error handling, including a
rollback mechanism. The onError attribute of updateBlock can take on
the following values: rollbackBlockAndFail, rollbackBlockAndContinue,
and ignore. The rollbackBlockAndFail value will roll back the
operations in an updateBlock and cause the entire request to fail. The
rollbackBlockAndFail value will do the rollback but will cause the
execution to continue at the next updateBlock. With ignore, processing
will continue without attempting a rollback.</p>
<p>The XML fragment in <a href="javascript:openWindow5();">Listing 5</a>
shows an updateRequest message attempting to delete an emailAddress
with an invalid ID while simultaneously trying to insert an
emailAddress into the main document. The updateRequest has the
rollbackBlockAndFail onError attribute. It also has a custom node named
comment slated for insertion into the {any} location of the
telephoneNumber blue element. This technique allows you to supplement
the default .Net Profile XML schema with namespace-qualified,
well-formed data to fit the needs of an application.</p>
<p>You can see the <a href="javascript:openWindow11();">output for the failure and rollback of the first update block</a> that is shown in <a href="javascript:openWindow5();">Listing 5</a>.</p>


<p>The second update block is never attempted because the first failure
causes termination of the request message. Modifying the onError
attribute to rollbackBlockAndContinue gives the second updateBlock a
chance to operate. This fragment shows the updated result with the
success status and the generation of a blue element with a new ID:</p>

<pre class="snippet">&lt;hs:updateResponse  
	xmlns:hs=
		"http://schemas.microsoft.com/hs/
		2001/10/core"  
	newChangeNumber="422"&gt;
&lt;hs:updateBlockStatus status=
	"rollback" selectedNodeCount="1"&gt;
	&lt;hs:deleteResponse status=

		"failure" selectedNodeCount="0"/&gt;
&lt;/hs:updateBlockStatus&gt;
&lt;hs:updateBlockStatus status=
	"success" selectedNodeCount="1"&gt;
	&lt;hs:insertResponse status=
	"success" selectedNodeCount="1"&gt;
		&lt;hs:newBlueId id=
			"220B5BF8-55EF-41D7-B8FC-
			BBCC07E80A6C"/&gt;
	&lt;/hs:insertResponse&gt;
&lt;/hs:updateBlockStatus&gt;
&lt;/hs:updateResponse&gt;</pre>

<p>The document-centric nature of .Net My Services and the HSDL command
set should be familiar to coders who've worked with tools such as XML
parsers and XSLT. Programmers who prefer a more traditional typed
approach to programming might have to spend a little more time working
with the system to appreciate its power and flexibility. Regardless of
the challenges, .Net My Services opens new doors and opportunities for
developers building user-centric applications.</p>
