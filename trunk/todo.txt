  + Add "Methods" functionality to subscriptions instead of just services.
  + Update "IqSms" plugin to support "ChangeNumber"/"Id" on inserted nodes.
  + Mobile Client Sdk must have hook allowing plugins to call "IqCore" without
    having to make their own reference. This web reference should be prefilled
    with information about currently logged on user.
  + Inspect why "alerts.soap" for sending Alerts doesn't work when used over
    WAN when it works properly on LAN.
