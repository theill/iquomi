    The Iquomi architecture is based around three main areas: individuals, groups and
    organizations. Each area could benefit by using Iquomi for their data queries.

    <b>For Individuals</b>
    <br />
    You as an individual who currently need to manage multiple devices each containing
    separate islands of data will benefit greatly, because Iquomi services can be accessed
    from any of them.

    <b>For Businesses</b>

    You as a developer will benefit too since Iquomi enables you to develop and deploy
    web services without having to provide the complete infrastructure yourself from
    scratch. The Iquomi SDK provides services such as authentication, security and privacy,
    metering, monitoring, audit and logging. You will be able to create user-centric
    solutions and worry only about established standards such as SOAP, XML, XML Schema
    and XPath (XQuery planned in future releases) no matter which platform and development
    language you are currently using.<br />
    <br />
    Without Iquomi you would have to do this necessary but dull aspects yourself.<br />
