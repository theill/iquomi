  20060122
   - Added IqSms service to suite of core services.
   - First version of a Windows Mobile Iquomi Client released.
   
  20051025
   - Added initial version of "service methods" allowing POST requests for
     easy access to information without requiring SOAP technologies.

  20051006
   - Removed part of web site allowing www.iquomi.com to be accessed without
     requiring credentials.
     
  20041009
   - Updated ServiceLocator class to create instances of any service proxy 
     class and setting up SoapAuthentication/SoapRequest attributes.
  
  20040908
   - Notification (iqAlerts) part breakthrough by enabling the ability for the
     XmlStore to send alerts to listening parties.
  
  20040810
   i Finished migrating entire project to .NET 2.0 beta.
  
  20040429
   - Updated ServiceUtils.GetObject- and .SetObject methods to get namespace
     from generated proxy class by reading its custom attributes.
   i Investigated possibility to read name of element from attributes as well
     as this would result in a more simple "SetObject" method.
   
  20040428
   - Improved Preferences dialog for Windows client by adding icons and making
     it use themes on Windows XP.
   
  20040422
   - Added "api" project containing client classes used by plugin developers.
   - Moved some classes from "sdk" project to "api" project in order to keep
     a simple client API.
   
  20040414
   - Schema updates for DL allowing "listenRequest" for setting up subscription
     listeners. These will catch events and propagate either to users Alerts
     service or directly to a listener implementation on external networks.
   
  20040412
   + Adding SubscriptionListener handling to support cross-service updates via
     events (based on changeNumber revisions).
   - Weekly meeting discussing "Eventing" implementation allowing services to
     communicate subscription changes transparently.
     
  20040404
   - Allowing namespaces in queries by importing aliases from service into the
     "system" document. This allows queries like /m:iqFavorites/m:favorite and
     avoid future namespace clashes.
  
  20040403
   - Updated web site with new styles stylesheet for controls.
   - Rearranged controls on web site to place field names above fields.
   - Researched ability to validate XSD referred from service. Needed to allow
     prefixes in XPath selections e.g. /m:iqFavorites.
   
  20040401
   - Figured out, that when including "targetNamespace" in an Xsd the instance 
     document must use a namespace e.g. <m:iqFavorites />.
  
  20040331
   + Notification discussed and prototype implemented.
   
  20040329
   - Researched SOA systems to find competitors.
   
  20040328
   - Streamlining services by adding IqPresence, IqAlerts, IqServices to suite
     and adding build scripts for generating proxy classes for them.
   - Researching WSDL generation based on concrete services.
  
  20040321
   - Modified Insert, Replace and Query to use "XmlElement[]" instead of 
     "string" for the "Any" attribute.
   - Updated IqFavorites Service to use new type looking almost like the 
     Microsoft "myFavoriteWebSites" schema and using XmlSerializer to use 
     classes generated from Xml Schema using xsd.exe.
   - Updated web design to include styled scrollbars.
