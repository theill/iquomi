        In order to operate the Iquomi service and to reduce the risk of fraud, Iquomi Corp.
        ("Iquomi" or "we") must ask you to provide us information about yourself and your
        credit card and/or bank account. This Privacy Policy describes the information we
        collect and how we use that information.
        <p />
        If you apply for a Iquomi VISA® credit card (available in the U.S. only), you authorize
        Iquomi and Providian National Bank (which is the issuer of the Iquomi VISA card)
        to exchange the information you provide in the application form. If you are approved
        for a Iquomi VISA credit card, your credit card account will be governed by the
        Providian Privacy Policy.
        <p />
        Iquomi takes the privacy of your personal information very seriously and will use
        your information only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will
        not sell or rent your personally identifiable information or a list of our customers
        to third parties. However, as described in more detail in Part C below, there are
        limited circumstances in which some of your information will be shared with third
        parties, under strict restrictions, so it is important for you to review this Privacy
        Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to all services that are hosted on the Iquomi.com
        Web site, whether the services are offered by Iquomi, by its subsidiaries, or by
        the Iquomi Money Market Fund.
        <p />
        Your privacy is important to us. By participating in the Council of Better Business
        Bureau's BBBOnLine® Privacy Program we have made a commitment to meet the program's
        strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and have it verified
        by BBBOnLine. Further information about this program is available at http://www.bbbonline.org.
