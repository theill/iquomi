<b></b><p><b>Remarks by Bill Gates<br>HailStorm Announcement<br>Redmond, Wash., March 19, 2001</b></p>

<p><b>	MR. GATES:</b> Good morning. We're excited to have this chance
to talk about a key piece of our .NET strategy. This is something we've
been working on for quite some time, and we've had the chance over the
last few months to roll it out to software developers to get their
feedback. In fact, last Thursday we had a full day session, and it was
really thrilling to hear from those people how they see opportunities
around this piece of the .NET platform, which was codenamed HailStorm.</p>

<p> The .NET vision encompasses the idea of having your information
wherever you want to go. This includes the future cell phones, your TV
set, your tablet form factor PC, your desktop PC, wherever you are, and
whatever role you're in, whether you're working, you're acting as a
family member, you're acting on behalf of some other group you belong
to, your information will be there available in the context that's most
appropriate for what you're trying to get done.</p>

<p> And so that vision of .NET leads to some very obvious things. One
is that you shouldn't have to repeat the same information in multiple
places. In fact, we go so far as saying that this whole vision of
having multiple devices can only work if, magically, behind the scenes,
the information is moving between those devices without the user having
to get directly involved.</p>

<p> Well, the computing industry has gone through a lot of revolutions,
and we find ourselves now at the beginning of the XML revolution, .NET
is simply Microsoft's platform for XML. In fact, if you look at every
one of these revolutions, Microsoft has had a set of implementation
that address the opportunity there. With the PC, it was an idea that we
really drove that hardware could be compatible across different
manufacturers, and that the software industry should be a very large
industry with literally tens of thousands of applications. That vision
really changed the world and created the software industry that we know
today. So the vision was the PC, the product was MS-DOS.</p>

<p> The next phase for graphics interface was something that several
companies, Xerox, Apple and ourselves, really bet our lives on. We said
this was the way to do computing. And actually until about five years
ago, there was a lot of uncertainty, people wondered if that was the
right approach. In fact, many application developers hesitated to do
graphical applications, while we and some other pioneers, again, bet
our future on graphics interface. Our product there was, of course,
Microsoft Windows.</p>

<p> The Internet revolution, which you can date from 1994, 1995,
different dates there, was one that really happened, from our point of
view, very suddenly, and we found ourselves stepping back and saying,
what was this phenomenon? And there were leaders like Netscape, or the
W3C doing great things there. And we responded by coming in with
Internet Information Server, a lot of programming tools like Visual
InterDev, and of course, our browser, Internet Explorer.</p>

<p> The Internet revolution was very exciting, the idea of pervasive
connectivity is, in fact, the foundation that this next revolution is
built on. It's by having that connectivity that we'll finally get
software that can easily stay up to date. By having that foundation,
that users will be able to get support for anything they want easily
over the Internet without having to work, calling up on the phone to
describe how they want their system to work in a different way.</p>

<p> This revolution has some very important technologies behind it.
It's not just about presentation onto a screen. It's not just about one
Web site at a time. This is a revolution where the user's creativity,
and the power of all the different devices can be fully engaged. I
talked at Comdex last year about how XML was a protocol that allows for
intelligence, both in the server and on the client itself. It's really
the best of both worlds there, unlike previous protocols that, of
course, all the intelligence either down to the client level, not
allowing the server to do what it does best, or vice versa, forcing
everything onto the server and then not being able to work offline,
work with multiple sets of data, and do the things that have really
characterized the PC revolution.</p>

<p> And so we're building a foundation here around XML. What's the
history here, when did this really start? Well, certainly some people
at Microsoft, like Jean Paoli, who was on that original XML committee
back in 1996, who talked about this as a five-year effort to really get
these things going. We first talked publicly about XML Web services in
September 1999. And I remember at the time, you know, we had some
people who really understood what we were saying, but overall a lot of
people said, hey, come on, why is this important, we've got HTML, you
can go to any Web site, isn't the future about e-anything, and all the
start-ups that are doing those HTML Web sites.</p>

<p> Well, we've been working on some key tools that go around this XML
advance. In fact, the big milestone for us will be the shipment of our
Visual Studio product later this year. That's the first development
tool that's really been built from the ground up around XML Web
services.</p>

<p> Now, on the Internet today, one of the problems we're addressing
here is that as you interact with these different sites, as you give
out your zip code, or your preferences, or as you work with these
devices, and you might update your calendar on your PDA device, and yet
you want to see that information through your PC, there's all this
disconnection taking place. And yet, most scenarios assume a high level
of connection. Take, for example, when planning a trip, you are likely
to want to use your full screen PC. That's going to let you see the
maps and the choices, and the budgets, and you'll do your organization
there as well as notify your friends of what you're thinking. But if at
some later time you're not in front of your PC but you simply have your
intelligent phone or PDA, you'd like to be notified if a flight is
canceled, or if somebody's plans change, and that means that you need
to make a change in the plan you've put together.</p>

<p> Well, that scenario says that the work you did on the PC is, in an
automatic way, available to you on that PDA. Not only that but your
interest in being notified, your preferences about what's important to
you and what's not important to you, if a flight time only changes by
five or ten minutes you probably would not want to be interrupted on
that device. And so it's the preferences and behavior you have across
all your devices should determine exactly how you're notified.</p>

<p> In fact, when you come back from a meeting you might be more
interested in being notified than when you're inside a meeting. And
when you go home you might be more interested in being notified about
things that relate to you in your personal capacity, as opposed to
things that relate to your job. And so stitching these islands together
is about having a standard schema, in fact, a very rich schema where
all this information is stored, and letting all the applications and
devices have access to the degree you give them permission to use and
update that information.</p>

<p> Now, schema is the technical term you're going to be hearing again
and again in this XML world. It's through schemas that information can
be exchanged, things like schemas for your appointments, schemas for
your health records. The work we're announcing today is a rather large
schema that relates to things of interest to an individual. And you'll
recognize very quickly what those things are, things like your files,
your schedule, your preferences, all are expressed in a standard form.
And so, by having that standard form, different applications can fill
in the information and benefit from reading out that information and
benefit from reading out that information. And so it's about getting
rid of these different islands.</p>

<p> It's really a necessary step in this revolution that there be
services like HailStorm. There's no way to achieve what users expect
and really get into that multiple device, information any time,
anywhere world without this advance. So you can envision the XML
platform as having two pieces. The foundation pieces that are done in
the standards committee, going back to that original XML work in 1996,
but now complemented by a wide range of things, things like X-TOP,
X-LINK, the schema standards that have come along.</p>

<p> One of the really key standards is this thing called SOAP, that's
the way that applications that were not designed together can
communicate and share information across the Internet. You can think of
it as a remote procedure call that works in that message-based, loosely
coupled environment. Now, the XML movement has gained incredible
momentum. I'd say the last year has really been phenomenal in terms of
the momentum that this has developed. Part of that is we also have
other large companies in the industry, besides Microsoft, really join
into this. So if you look at two of the recent standards, SOAP and
UDDI, we had many partners, including IBM, that were involved in a very
deep way, helping to design that standard, and really standing up and
saying that was critical to their whole strategy. And so you're seeing
a real shift towards these XML Web services, a real shift away from
people saying it's one computer language, or it's just about one kind
of app server, to an approach now that is far more flexible around XML.</p>

<p> The kind of dreams that people have had about interoperability in
this industry will finally be fulfilled by the XML revolution. And so,
although we're focusing on HailStorm today, it's important to
understand that this XML approach allows data of all types, business
application data, to move easily between different platforms, between
different companies in a very simple way.</p>

<p> Now, individual companies need to take that foundation piece and
come up with the implementation that make it a reality. And that's what
Microsoft.NET is. So any time you think about this XML revolution you
can say to yourself, okay, its Microsoft's implementation that makes
that possible, that's what their .NET strategy is. So .NET encompasses
most everything we're doing as a company. It encompasses enhancements
we're making to Microsoft Office, it encompasses this new work in
Visual Studio that we actually named VisualStudio.NET. There's a lot
we're doing in Windows to make it work as a client inside this XML
world. And so everything we're doing is deeply influenced here.</p>

<p> When the Internet revolution came along, I wrote a memo called The
Internet Tidal Wave, and that really spoke to everyone in the company
about how they needed to make Internet support their top priority. We
had a lot of retreats, we talked about it, and we got that built into
our plan, and we were really pleased about how that focus led to a lot
of very rapid innovation. Here in this XML revolution I can say that
the company is even more focused on this than we were on that previous
Internet revolution.</p>

<p> Part of it is that we're one of the leaders here, we're way out in
front on this, and we can see the scenarios that are important. But,
the other thing is that a lot of the foundation work that we've been
doing that goes way back really points us in this direction, work that
we've been doing in our database, work that we've been doing at the
protocol level, thinking we've had about what are notifications and how
should those be used, all fit in a natural way into the .NET products
that we're putting together.</p>

<p> So at the end of the day, each one of those revolutions succeeded
because of what they provided to end users. PCs let people deal with
information in a way they never had been before, it changed the whole
dynamic of thinking about computers, from a tool of the organization to
a tool of the individual. The graphic interface changed the way the
applications work, allowed you to have rich presentation and rich user
interface. It put the user in control, where they could select
information and drag and drop it. It created standards for what
applications looked like. Some of you will remember that in the MS DOS
world applications all had a very different look, and there was no
ability to exchange information. So graphics interface had some
dramatic benefits that eventually made it common sense. Likewise, the
Internet as a revolution in communications. </p>

<p> Here with XML the user benefits are equally compelling. It&#8217;s about
putting users in control of their information. So there are some simple
principles here. You should never have to enter the same information
multiple times. Any time that you&#8217;ve given permission for information
to be used, it should be used on your behalf to customize the
information to make it most appropriate for you. </p>

<p> And so by building this schema, all your information literally can
be available in any interaction with the Web site, or even if you pick
up a device that you don&#8217;t own, if you authenticate yourself, your
preferred home page, your preferences about notification -- all of
those can come down from these HailStorm services onto that device and
work on your behalf. And so this is technology that will work on behalf
of the user.</p>
<font face="Courier New">
</font><p><font face="Courier New">	</font>One key point we make here
is that the user will see the HailStorm infrastructure through the
applications. They won&#8217;t need to directly think about interacting with
it, but it&#8217;s there, and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s making the applications work
together on behalf of the user.</p>

<p> The HailStorm platform, which is part of .NET, is something that
we&#8217;re implementing, but it&#8217;s something that we are allowing any
third-party applications to work against. And that&#8217;s true across all
the different devices. And perhaps it will surprise you to see us
showing HailStorm on a lot of devices, including non-Microsoft devices,
today. </p>

<p> So today is a milestone for us. It&#8217;s the public rollout of these
user-centric XML Web services. It is a new model for user-centric
computing. This is not the world of cookies and things that are very
opaque to users. This is a world of a very explicit schema that you
choose how you want to control the different parts of that schema in
terms of how you fill in the information and where it is made
available. This is what we call a .NET building block service. In fact,
it&#8217;s probably the most important .NET building block service.</p>

<p> The opportunity for the industry here is really quite substantial.
And I use the word "industry" very broadly here, because as you will
see from the demos today, there are businesses of all types, as well as
our traditional software partners that are coming in and seeing that
they can do new things like connecting Internet applications, devices
and services together. And so it really is about some of the dreams and
visions that people have had all along for how computers ought to work.</p>

<p> Now, how do you get at HailStorm? You get at HailStorm by providing
your credentials. Our service for authenticating credentials is called
Microsoft Passport. You provide the passport, and then your schema is
available to you. And so you can see here over on the right -- I&#8217;m not
going to dive into the schema -- for those of you who are technical,
you can get the development kit, and you&#8217;ll find that there are
literally hundreds of pages talking about these different things. For
example, myWallet -- that&#8217;s where you put the different credit cards
you like to use, so that any time you are doing a transaction you&#8217;ll
get to choose which of those credit card things that you want to use
for that transaction. myCalendar -- that&#8217;s extremely important here,
because that helps determine when you get notified of different things,
when you might be interested in things. Your address book, your
application settings, your documents -- many of these things will be
familiar, but you&#8217;ll realize these are things that today you have to
get involved in moving around. And in fact finding things and knowing
where they can move around -- particularly between different types of
devices -- is very, very complex. And today they are not designed to
deal with the fact that you operate in different modes -- at work and
at home -- and you operate on different devices. And so HailStorm has
that richness built into the direct design.</p>

<p> Passport is achieving very significant critical mass. All Hotmail
users, of course, get a Passport. There are many third-party Web sites
that we are working with to make sure that they get people to use
Passport as part of their authentication. In fact, that was part of the
relationship we had with people like eBay and many others, is to say,
let&#8217;s get Passport, so you only have to log in one time, and you get
exactly what you want there. So it&#8217;s our goal to have virtually
everybody who uses the Internet to have one of these Passport
connections.</p>

<p> What&#8217;s the relationship of Windows XP to HailStorm? Well, Windows
XP is a HailStorm endpoint. We are going to make it very easy when you
use this new version of Windows to get to your HailStorm information.
Now, at the same time we want to be very clear that HailStorm is not
exclusively tied to any particular operating system -- not even
Windows, if you include all the different versions that are out there.
We make it particularly easy in Windows XP to get to HailStorm, but
that can be done in any platform that&#8217;s out there. </p>

<p> The plumbing for HailStorm is in the operating system, the XML and
type support, that you will see many different applications using it.
And so Windows XP is really the first version of Windows that makes it
easy to get out to these kind of services. And we are very proud of
that, because as we think of a lot of things people want to do with
their PC, having these services is going to make a big difference
there. So big milestone for us -- something that we are still in the
process of getting user feedback. So the exact specification that we
have got for this thing will be modified as we go along between now and
when the release is. But we have got it now out, so that any developer
can look at this in different businesses are already doing some amazing
things with this.</p>

<p> So the best way to understand HailStorm is probably to see it in
action. So let me ask Vic to come back on out, and he&#8217;ll introduce some
of these partners who give you a real sense of what this is about.</p>

<p>	<b>MR. GUNDOTRA:</b> Okay, thank you, Bill. You know, Bill talked
about how HailStorm really changes the end user experience, and we are
very excited about those types of services you will be hearing more
about throughout the day. But even before HailStorm we have a set of
platform Web services that are available now -- like Passport and
Notification -- that start to give you a glimmer, an idea, of how the
end user experience really gets changed. And we are going to show you
several demonstrations by our partners who adopted these technologies
and services that are available even now, like Passport and
Notification.</p>

<p> Before we go into the demonstrations, I should probably lay a
little bit of context. Throughout the demonstration you will see us use
or utilize Passport as an authentication mechanism. Passport really
solves a problem that I am sure you&#8217;ve experienced. Every time you go
to a Web site, an application or device, you are often prompted for a
Passport. And managing different passports for every Web site can
become a burden. Really Passport enables the end user to seamlessly log
on to every site or service that supports Passport -- a very easy user
experience, and you&#8217;ll see that.</p>

<p> We&#8217;ll also talk about notifications. Notifications you are probably
most familiar with in the context of things like instant messaging. But
we are not talking about just teen chats. We&#8217;re talking about something
radically different. We are talking about using a broad platform for
notification to allow applications to call and notify the user of
important things -- Bill referenced a flight being late. You can think
of many other examples. You may have been outbid on a particular
auction. Your bank balance may have been exceeded. So the idea of a
broad programmatic platform that businesses can use to call into these
notifications is something that you&#8217;ll see. So that&#8217;s to get right into
it.</p>

<p> To begin with our first demonstration, I&#8217;d like to invite out the
executive vice president and CIO of American Express, and there we go
-- Glenn Sallow, welcome. Please come on up here -- and as well as
Steve Dirk, who is director of development. Glenn, why don&#8217;t you talk
to us about what you are going to show.</p>

<p>	<b>MR. SALLOW:</b> Good morning. I&#8217;m really excited to join you
today along with my colleague Dirk White, who is the director of the
interactive group. We get really excited at American Express when we
can find ways to make life easier, more secure and more private -- for
our customers, for our merchants, for our employees, for our financial
advisors. And so as we have been working with Microsoft in this arena,
we have come up with, we think, some pretty interesting ideas. And what
Dirk is going to do today is give you an idea of what the future might
look like for American Express in this technology. Dirk?</p>

<b><font face="Courier New"></font></b><p><b><font face="Courier New">	</font>MR. WHITE:</b>
Thank you, Glenn. Good morning. Today I am going to be demonstrating a
functionality that is at the heart of American Express -- payment,
security and customer service. We believe that by leveraging services
from Microsoft, such as Notification and Passport, and combining those
services with services from American Express, such as smart card
authentication and payment services, that we can create a compelling
value proposition to the consumer, the merchant, and American Express.</p>

<p> Let&#8217;s take a look at an example that illustrates this. The other
day I went shopping at an online bookstore. And the book I was
interested in was out of stock. So I asked the merchant to notify me
once that book becomes available. Now, this merchant obviously is
integrated with the Passport as well and Notification services, so the
merchant is now in a position to be sending me a notification. I&#8217;m on
the Web, I&#8217;m on my PC, and here you see the alert comes up, and it&#8217;s
telling me that the book, "Before the Win," is now available. That was
the book I was interested in. Once I click on that book I am taken
directly to the merchant page that contains all the pertinent
information about the product I was interested in -- the book title
itself, the price and so forth. But, most importantly, it puts me in a
position to buy the book. So I am going to go ahead and buy this book
and add it to the cart, and continue to the checkout page. And now,
since I am a Passport user, I am going to use the most convenient user
experience I can, which is myWallet. I&#8217;m going to go ahead and click
the Express Purchase button. And, as you can see, it pre-filled by blue
from American Express -- that&#8217;s my default card in myWallet. And since
I can&#8217;t imagine using any other form of payment, I&#8217;m going to go ahead
and use American Express. So we&#8217;re going to go ahead and click
"continue." And now I&#8217;m ready -- additionally you can see that my name
was pre-filled, as well as my address, once again preventing me -- or
keeping me having to type in that information -- creating that nice
user experience.</p>

<p> I&#8217;m going to go ahead and continue through the checkout process.
Now, what you see happening here is now the screen has detected that I
have a reader attached to my PC. Additionally it has detected I&#8217;m using
Blue from American Express. And American Express is telling me I can
transact securely. We believe that by integrating Passport and the
American Express SmartCard that we can ensure that the card was used,
that the PIN was entered, and that the identity was verified. That
creates a secure transaction. That secure transaction has real value to
everyone -- the consumer, the merchant, and American Express.
Additionally, we can provide and create that value and send it back to
our consumers in a variety of ways. We could for example offer our
consumers American Express membership award points for purchasing with
their blue card. We can offer a discount. There are a variety of
options.</p>

<p>	What we are going to do first here is I am going to use this Blue card, and we are going to insert it into the reader --</p>

<p>	<b>MR. GUNDOTRA:</b> Now, Dirk, I&#8217;m going to interrupt you. You
have a reader there attached to the PC. I doubt most people in this
room have a reader. I don&#8217;t have a reader. How do you solve that
problem?</p>

<p>	<b>MR. WHITE:</b> Well, today all blue card members can get a free
reader from American Express. Additionally, if you purchase a contact
keyboard it is also embedded in the keyboard itself.</p>

<p>	<b>MR. GUNDOTRA:</b> Oh, that&#8217;s great.</p>

<b><font face="Courier New"></font></b><p><b><font face="Courier New">	</font>MR. WHITE:</b>  So there&#8217;s a variety of options here.</p>

<p> Now, one thing to point out here -- we have got our Blue card up
here. And if you notice on the upper left here there&#8217;s a chip on the
card. Aside from having a variety of functionality, the primary
functionality is the ability to identify the user. There is a
certificate on there that uniquely identifies me to that card. And that
allows American Express to create the secure payment and provide this
value. </p>

<p> So I am going to go ahead and insert it into the reader. And, as
you can see now, American Express is prompting for a PIN. So we are
going to go ahead and enter that PIN. And we are going to complete this
transaction. And as you see now, it says, "Thank you for shopping with
Blue from American Express."</p>

<p> So what did we just do? We brought information to the consumer, we
put the consumer in a position to buy, we provided value to our
customer, the merchants and American Express, and we did it securely
with Blue from American Express.</p>

<p> That&#8217;s just one example. Let&#8217;s look at another example of how we
can provide real value to our customers. And you see here the Messenger
window. The Messenger window, which will be available always on your
desktops -- as you&#8217;ll notice there is a tab on there, and it&#8217;s an
American Express tab. That tab has specific information that American
Express is providing for this customer. Some examples of that right
here you can see are previous shopping purchases and card balances --
very powerful information, real-time that can be sent to the consumer
directly on his desktop.</p>

<p> Additionally, the consumer has the ability to configure this
information. So we are going to go ahead and click that. So the user
can say, you know what, for American Express I am very interested about
hearing about when my bill payments come. I want to know when my
settlements occur. I want to know about potential fraudulent activity
on my card. I want to know when my account is maybe going past due --
all of these are examples of information that can be configured by the
user. </p>

<p> So let&#8217;s take a look at how these notifications can help in a
customer service experience. Now, let&#8217;s say that American Express has
detected some irregular spending on my account -- potential fraudulent
activity. And American Express wants to let the consumer know that they
make sure you are aware of it. So American Express is going to now
notify the consumer of this. And as you can see here, potential
fraudulent activity on your card. We are going to go ahead and click on
notification. And now that notification took us directly to the page
that contains all the important information about the charge in
question, the card that was used, the date of the purchase, and,
actually, the location. </p>

<p>Now, I may or may not be familiar with this charge, $742, but I want
to contact American Express to find out about it. So I&#8217;m going to go
ahead and click here. And American Express is providing me with a
couple of options here. I can use an 800 number or, in keeping with the
spirit that Bill talked about this morning, about "any time, any place
and on any device," American Express customer service reps will be
available any time, any place and on any device. And here we&#8217;re going
to allow them -- to contact them. So we&#8217;re going to click here. And now
American Express is going to notify me on my device that I&#8217;m working on
when they&#8217;re ready. This is going to allow me to get back to doing
things that are important to me, like finishing that game of Motocross
Madness that I was playing. Now, I am going to continue, and hopefully
this notification will be coming up and those American Express guys are
good, and they&#8217;ll let me know that they&#8217;re ready. So I am going to go
ahead and click.</p>
<font face="Courier New">
</font><p><font face="Courier New">	</font>Now, something powerful just
happened here. There are two things that just happened. Not only are we
in a live chat now with the customer service rep, but additionally what
was associated with that notification was the link to the American
Express customer service base. This puts it right in front of the
consumer&#8217;s face -- putting in our customer service rep in a position to
reference the information if needed. So this creates a very, very
powerful way of communicating. </p>

<p> As you can see here, there are a couple of other options we can
look at. We could start up a videoconference with the customer service
rep. We could also start talking. We could send a file. You can even
imagine that I could have sent that notification to American Express,
got in my car, went off to work, and have the notification sent to my
cell phone. All of these are powerful, powerful examples of how we can
help improve our customer&#8217;s experience for all of our American Express
customers.</p>

<p> Let me just say, in closing, that American Express feels that we
can provide real value to our customers using this technology. And for
the consumer we believe that we can create a secure, private shopping
experience. And this will continue to help American Express become the
premier payments provider on the Web today. And, most importantly,
allow us to accept payments anywhere, anytime, and on any device. Thank
you.</p>

<b><font face="Courier New"></font></b><p><b><font face="Courier New">	</font>MR. GUNDOTRA:</b>
What a great demonstration of Passport, notification and the power of
American Express too. Thank you very much, Dirk. Thank you, Glenn. </p>

<p> Let&#8217;s continue on here. I&#8217;m going to move over to the other podium,
and I&#8217;d like to invite CEO and chairman of Groove Networks, Ray Ozzie
and Jack Ozzie. Ray, welcome. Thank you for coming. Why don&#8217;t you talk
to us about how Groove Networks could utilize these same technologies?</p>

<b><font face="Courier New"></font></b><p><b><font face="Courier New">	</font>MR. OZZIE:</b>
Sure. I&#8217;m not sure how many of you are familiar with Groove Networks or
Groove. Groove is a new kind of software. It&#8217;s kind of radically
different than the other types people have worked with in the past. And
what it&#8217;s really about is enabling individuals out on the Internet who
need to work together the ability very quickly, very spontaneously, to
get together, to share information, to interact with one another -- you
know, directly, spontaneously over the Net, even across firewall
boundaries.</p>

<p> One of the interesting issues that you have when you have software
like Groove is getting people together, that it ultimately begins in
getting people together. And we believe that the services -- and you&#8217;ll
see this in a moment -- the services that are inherent to HailStorm
provide for a much richer user experience, and in general put the user
in control of information that I think formerly has been in the control
of apps of various types.</p>

<p> I should note that the word "Groove" itself was chosen as the
company name because user experience is just about everything to our
apps and how we envision this panning out. There are many, many, many
ways that people can get together and share information on the Net.
Having a good, crisp user experience was really fundamental to what we
are doing, and that&#8217;s really why I am excited about this whole thing.</p>

<p> Let me begin by showing something here. This is the Groove user
interface. And this is not going to be a Groove demo, but essentially
Groove is about bringing, very spontaneously, the right people together
with the right information that they care about, and the right tools to
manipulate that information at the right time.</p>

<p> Step one is to get the people together. And this thing that you are
seeing here is the user interface to an area called a shared space.
It&#8217;s a place where people meet. But you have to get people in there.
And Groove itself has a contact list built in, because you have to
build up a list of people who you like to interact with. As it turns
out, though, people have other contact lists, and that&#8217;s why we put
other integration features into Groove, to integrate it with things
like email, because people don&#8217;t want to take their contacts out of
their email and move them into Groove -- they just want to use the
tools where they have those contacts. And, as it turns out, the user
then has some contacts in Groove, some contacts in Outlook, some
contacts in other places, because those contacts are really under
control of the application.</p>

<p> HailStorm gives us as application developers the ability to access
a central repository of the user&#8217;s contacts, and it gives the user the
ability to put the contacts in a place where it can be accessed by --
they can be accessed by any applications that they use, and on any
devices they happen to be using. And I think that&#8217;s very critical to
the user interface experience. Let&#8217;s run through a little scenario here
involving Groove, and maybe you can get more of a flavor for what that
means.</p>

<p> As you saw in the previous demo, there&#8217;s a little tab on messenger
here, and essentially it&#8217;s the Windows shell extension that lets Groove
put part of its user interface right there in the shell, because it&#8217;s a
very natural place for the user. The user is interacting with his
buddies or her buddies in this user interface. So in this case you can
see that Jack has a conversation space active where there are -- Ray
Ozzie and Ken Moore are members. He also has a project space where
these other people are members. Because the Windows XP shell has access
to the same contact information in HailStorm that we do, we kind of
share those contacts. So XP can display the awareness information of
people who are also interacting in Groove.</p>

<p>	<b>MR. GUNDOTRA:</b>  Jack, why don&#8217;t you go to the buddy list?</p>

<p>	<b>MR. RAY OZZIE:</b> Probably the most powerful thing, an
integration feature of being enabled with HailStorm services, is the
ability for a Groove user to say, "Okay, I&#8217;d like to start interacting
in Groove with this other user, but I&#8217;m going to start in an interface
that I&#8217;m very familiar with." So in this case, let&#8217;s say Jack wanted to
start working on a project with me in Groove, he'd start by selecting
my name, and he'd select the invite menu option, and as you can see, if
you can see this, it says Groove Project Space, Groove Conversation
Space. He can essentially from the messenger say, I would like to
initiate a project with Ray in Groove right from this interface. So,
Jack, why don't you do that.</p>

<p>	<b>MR. JACK OZZIE:</b>  So, demo welling, there it is, there's the Groove notification.  This wasn't Groove sending this.</p>

<p>	<b>MR. GUNDOTRA:</b>  And that's on another machine.</p>

<p>	<b>MR. RAY OZZIE:</b> That's right. That's on another machine.
These two machines are on a simple local area network. You know, they
could be anywhere on the Internet. Essentially, the centralized
notification services were used here to get the notification from one
computer to another. And, as it says here, Jack is inviting you to
start using Groove, do you want to accept or decline the invitation,
and so I'll accept. And the moment I accept, essentially there's a
control transfer from the Windows XP environment into the Groove
environment, and it's seamless, because the context that you're seeing
displayed there in Groove are the same contacts that are being used by
the Messenger user interface because they're both accessed through the
HailStorm API.</p>

<p> So, in this case, Jack might do something simple, like sharing some
Microsoft Office documents, or if we were engineers we might do
something a little bit more advanced or interesting, like working on a
CAD drawing, or something like that. And we could collaborate together.
The essential thing to remember here, though, is that getting into the
space is an extremely important thing. Groove's core design principle
is to bring the right people together with the right information and
tools, and the HailStorm services make it very, very easy for people to
get together because it has the central repository of contacts
available to all apps.</p>

<p> So, we look forward to working with Microsoft, and implementing a
number of the different HailStorm centralized services. And this only
showed centralized contact store, and notification store, but there are
many, many, many other points of integration we can do on behalf of the
user.</p>
<b>
</b><p><b>	MR. GUNDOTRA:</b>  Thank you very much, Ray.</p>

<p>	Thank you, Jack.</p>

<p> As you can see, Ray shares our enthusiasm for these broad platform
services. I'm going to go back to the podium here, and invite Gil
Penchina, who is director of business development at eBay.</p>

<p>	Gil, welcome.  Why don't you show us how eBay views these technologies.</p>

<p>	<b>MR. PENCHINA:</b> Great. eBay is an approximately $5 billion
global marketplace that enables people to trade everywhere throughout
the world. Now, on eBay you can get everything from a Cisco router to a
new pair of Gucci loafers, to, starting tonight, my new .NET pen Sanjiv
gave to me about five minutes ago. So, if you're looking for it, the
price is about $2, and should be, let the bidding start early.</p>

<p> We have been very successful in building a consumer portal for
shopping. But over the last year, we've been trying to figure out how
to take this destination site and turn it into an e-commerce platform.
And as we talked to the folks at Microsoft, it was very clear to us
that we shared a common vision for Web services. So we announced last
week a strategic partnership with Microsoft primarily focused on trying
to enable our existing API efforts to work with their .NET and Web
services initiatives, and try to create an eBay platform that's easier
for everyone to use.</p>

<p> So, we wanted to take you through a couple of things that we've
jointly been thinking about over the last six months. On the screen
here, you can see the auction wizard. There are a number of third party
developers today who have built applications that let you sell on eBay.
The problem was, they used screen scraping. You basically take data
from our site, and then post data to our site. And one of the problems
is, every time our site changed, their software broke. So, we'd get all
the calls saying, hey, you guys added a new category structure, you
know, and now my software is broken.</p>

<p> So, through .NET we have the ability to create a category structure
like the one you're seeing here, and have it programmatically
accessible from the client. So this software is actually real-time
accessing our category structure, and if something is changed, it
changes in the software.</p>

<p> So, I'm going to go in, and I'm going to sell a football, and take
the picture of the football, put it in, put in a little description of
the item, some story about it, talk about my payment methods, and how
I'm willing to accept payment. And the nice thing here, there are a
couple of really neat things here. The first is, instead of going to
the eBay database several times, and putting in each piece of data
separately, we're able to do this all on Windows and then send the data
all up in one piece.</p>

<p>	So, let's send the data up, if we could.</p>

<p>	<b>MR. GUNDOTRA:</b>  I noticed, I wasn't prompted for user name or password.</p>

<p>	<b>MR. PENCHINA:</b> The other nice thing is, you're seamlessly
logged into eBay, and you can see there is a couple of alerts here that
just popped up through TOS. So, let's take a look at those, whoops,
they're already gone. Well, we'll tell you what they were anyway. The
first is a notification that my item has been put up for sale. So, it
lets me know that my transaction is done, and I've been alerted, again,
without having to go out to the Web. And the second was an outbid
notice, I've been bidding on a lunchbox for my daughter for the last
couple of weeks, and it looks like I've been outbid again. Well, one of
the neat things with this whole .NET notification is that I can get the
alert on my desktop. I can get it on my Blackberry. I can get it on my
phone. I have the ability to sort of define my preferences. And that
means a couple of things to us, one is, I don't have to go keep
searching for the item when I get outbid, I can have more chances to
get alerted to it. The other is, we think it will actually result in
higher sales for us, because if you get alerted, you have a chance to
go back and bid again, and we think it will raise the average price for
our items over time, because people will not forget about the auction,
they'll get last minute notification, and come back and bid again.</p>

<p> So, we're pretty excited about some of these notification
initiatives. We're also talking with Microsoft about creating a tab
within their client. And you can see an example of this here. Basically
what this creates is a real-time information portal that lets you get
updates on the items that you're bidding on, the items that you're
watching, and the items that you're interested in. So now, instead of
going to the actual item and having to hit refresh over and over again
for the last five minutes of the auction, which costs us a lot of
money, you get pushed real-time data. So, when the item price changes,
you'll actually see it right there on your desktop real-time.</p>

<p> So, this is sort of a couple of examples of what we think of the
real power of combining the two platforms is. And if we can scroll down
a little, you can see the lunchbox my daughter hopes to get. Now, we
think some of these are really neat, but what's truly exciting to us is
the opportunity to combine with Microsoft in creating platforms,
because the power of platforms are really not just creating this
destination site where you can buy the lunchbox, but enabling e-Bay to
sort of become a global marketplace, where third parties can develop
new sorts of tools. You know, where's the Bloomberg for eBay, where's
the seller productivity tools for eBay, you know, new ways for buyers
to interact with eBay. And all these sort of tools become much more
easy to develop when you leverage the eBay API with the .NET services,
and the programming tools that they create.</p>

<p> So, in short, we're very excited about this, and we're looking
forward to working with Vic and his team to develop some of these
services over the next several years.</p>

<p>	<b>MR. GUNDOTRA:</b>  Thank you very much, Gil.</p>

<p>	<b>MR. PENCHINA:</b>  Thanks.</p>

<p>	<b>MR. GUNDOTRA:</b> Now, as Gil, and Ray, and Glen have shown you,
there are some pretty compelling things you can do with just the
authentication provided by Passport, and the notification services,
which are even available today. But there's so much more to HailStorm.
And to give you an idea of the breadth of HailStorm, we'd like to
invite up our distinguished engineer and architect of HailStorm, Mark
Lucovsky.</p>

<p>	Mark.  There you go, Mark, I think you want to go over there.  Very good.</p>

<p>	<b>MR. LUCOVSKY:</b> Hi. So, I'm going to talk a little bit about
the architecture of HailStorm. I'll try not to get too deep, but I
wanted to start giving you a deeper picture of what this system is all
about. We start by putting the user at the very center of the platform.
That becomes the central pivot point for how we navigate some of these
schemas that Bill was talking about. So, for instance, we'll take
something like a calendar, and tie that to an individual, to a user,
and that is the mechanism that software will use to find data, you
know, about that person's calendar. So we're kind of taking the
traditional model and turning it inside out. Instead of having an
application be your gateway to the data, we, in HailStorm, the user is
the gateway to the data. So we take these datasets, these pieces of
schema, and you navigate off the user.</p>

<p> So, that's obvious when you think about a calendar, it's a person's
calendar, and software has access to it through that individual. We do
the same thing with another service, myLocation, that's the centerpiece
about how we describe peer-to-peer presence, how applications can
communicate with each other. When I'm running an application like
Groove, like Ray and Jack demoed, Groove has a presence on your behalf,
and we expose that presence through my location. So, again, we take
presence data and we turn it inside out and we say that our presence
network is now available to all applications. It doesn't matter if it's
a chat-type communication application, or it's a collaborative work
group application, any application can have presence, and we find that
application running on your behalf by navigating through the individual.</p>

<p> It's not just calendar and location, we have a whole array of
services that you find by going to the individual. We have Inbox, where
your email streams are made available to software applications. So,
instead of controlling the application through a set of objects, or OLE
interfaces, we find your mail by its data format, the same thing for
your address, your address books, your application settings, your
favorite Web sites, your documents, your wallet, music preferences, and
also your notification stream. So this model is repeated, and it
doesn't end. I mean, this spiral of services that we can tie to an
identity is virtually limitless. So we extend the schema by rolling out
these new services over time.</p>

<p> Now, HailStorm isn't just about individuals. Obviously we can tie a
bunch of services to a user, and open up those services to software.
But, we can do the same thing for groups. So something like a soccer
club could be provisioned with a mailbox that mail sent to the soccer
club comes into this service repository, this XML document. That same
group can have an address book, or a set of contacts, the group can
also have a calendar. So, it's individuals and groups.</p>

<p> We can do the same thing for an organization. So, you take Beaver
Lake Middle School, for instance, how do they say that next Friday is a
half-day in a programmable way, and make that information available to
an application that wants to merge your calendar with the school's
calendar? We do that by provisioning that organization with an
identity, with a HailStorm ID, and we hang these XML services off of
that ID and we navigate to them the same way we would do for an
individual, we do that for a group or an organization.</p>

<p> HailStorm is all about XML. I mean, this is hardcore concept in my
group. Every single one of these services that we showed you in that
circle diagram is represented as an XML document. So your mail looks
like a set of mail folders, and a set of mail headers, and software can
navigate that XML document using the XML processing style that that
application is mated to. It can use our .NET runtime, which is a great
way to navigate XML, it can use XSL to do data transforms, it uses
standard XML query navigation techniques. It's up to the application
and up to the scenarios that the application is designed to deliver on.</p>

<p> An address book, the same sort of thing, it looks like an XML
document, it actually is an XML document, and that's the only way that
it's presented outside of HailStorm. You can do a query and get a chunk
of XML, you can manipulate it by doing standard XML data manipulation
techniques.</p>

<p> The same thing with your calendar. We're not proposing an object
model on top of a calendar and distributing DLLs to allow access to it.
The calendar is an XML document that software will manipulate using XML
techniques.</p>

<p> So, I'm going to show a little bit of HailStorm in action. Some of
you guys that were at the Forum 2000 event might remember some of these
video clips. What we're going to do is look at these video clips now in
the context of HailStorm, and see how HailStorm is the underpinnings
for some of the cool things that are happening in those video clips.</p>

<p> We announced .NET at Forum 2000. A lot of these video scenarios
looked like the Jetsons, way out there kind of stuff, but I think
you'll see with this HailStorm model, and with this XML-centric view
that we've taken, these videos can come to life by running software
that we write software, that you guys write software, that are
partners, right, it all comes together by taking the data and unlocking
it from the applications that typically wrap the data, by making that
data, those XML streams available through the open protocols, and
available to any application.</p>

<p>	So, let's watch this first clip here.</p>

<p>	(Video clip shown.)</p>

<p>	<b>MR. LUCOVSKY:</b> So everything that happened there, as you can
see, this family is now able to use the calendar, every member of the
family can publish information to a family calendar, and the
application software can fold together multiple calendars into an
aggregated or combined view. And all that happened in terms of
HailStorm is the dad has a myContacts service, and the members of his
family are in his address book, so that calendar processing software,
XML processing software in the middle, can take a little bit of his
calendar, a little bit of the calendar from his family members, and
show a combined or aggregated view. You can't do that today in any
platform, unless you're in kind of a closed environment where in the
calendaring system you can share. In HailStorm that sharing is
available across application boundaries very, very easily.</p>

<p> The next video is a teenage daughter communicating with her
friends, and buying music, and any of you that have teenagers, you
know, how communication and music kind of becomes the center of their
lives. And we're able to deliver on the scenario portrayed in this
video by using the HailStorm wallet service, the address book service,
the myMusic service, notification streams, mail, and then the person's
address. So let's watch this one real quick.</p>

<p>	(Video shown.)</p>

<p>	<b>MR. LUCOVSKY:</b> So let's look at what just happened in here,
but I think we can all agree that this is a pretty cool scenario, and I
think that the way that this scenario can come to life is by taking
this broad set of services and making the XML data inside those
services just widely available so that people developing software can
have a lot of fun with these services that we're delivering.</p>

<p> So Jenna and Christie are cross linked to each other through their
myContacts service. So that's like the center of how you deal with your
electronic relationships. And we don't just organize these things by
folders. You can have rich, rich semantics on top of what a contact is,
and how you can to use that contact in the various applications that
you choose to use it in. So the first part is they're cross linked, so
now Christie can send mail to Jenna's Inbox, and the mail can now be
read to Jenna. This is, I think, one of the cooler parts of this. Jenna
has the myMusic service populated with her favorite bands, the play
lists, the sequences of songs she likes to listen to, and she also has
a relationship with EMI Music, and she's chosen to share pieces of that
service with EMI.</p>

<p> So now EMI can know what her favorite band is, it also knows where
she lives for billing purposes, and so what EMI can now do is say, I
know the bands and what their concert schedules are. I know from my
customers that have chosen to share that information with me what their
favorite bands are, so now I can make offers to those guys. When Fatboy
Slim comes to town EMI can send a ticket offer to Jenna's
myNotification service, and that ticket offer can show up on her
screen. And that offer can have an expiration time, a time to live
associated with the notification. So if Jenna acts on it quickly she's
going to the concert, if she doesn't act on it quickly EMI can send
that same notification to their next tier of customers.</p>

<p> Jenna chooses to purchase the ticket, it's a seamless transaction
made possible by the myWallet service. So she can just say, yes, I want
to do it, and EMI can then go do a transaction against the myWallet and
get paid. It's a very seamless experience, again, it's XML that's tying
all this stuff together. And then at the end, of course, she does a
little voice call to her friend Christie to tell her that she's going
to the concert. That's a notification, you saw plenty of examples of
notification. So this is a kind of notification that says, I want to do
this kind of communicator call with you, and so she navigates to
Christie's myNotification service, sends a blob of XML saying let's
talk, and you saw the interchange at the end.</p>

<p> So the last scenario, you've seen a couple of more consumerism end
user scenarios, this is how HailStorm is going to be used in more of a
small business environment. And again, it's the same central themes,
you have XML services in HailStorm that are made available to a wide
array of software, and this we're going to show off how the HailStorm
document storage system would be used, how the address service would be
used to find what the Web sites are for a business, calendar
aggregation which is already seen, mail which we've already seen, and
UDDI which we use to discover other marketplaces. So let's watch this
video, too.</p>

<p>	(Video shown.)</p>
<b>
</b><p><b>	MR. LUCOVSKY:</b> I'm not going to go through this one in
too much detail. I think you get the idea -- document creation.
HailStorm doesn't address the creation of documents, but we provide
places to store those documents, and make the properties and meta
information about those documents available across the Internet using
SOAP and XML. How did we discover the new markets, the Acorns and the
FSIs, where to publish the pointer to that document? That's what UDDI
is designed for, it's designed to answer those questions. I'm looking
for a set of services that can do this for my business, give me back
some pointers so that I can start making Web services calls with that
business end point. You've seen email before, but what's unique about
this is the same email system that Alex has in her office is available
on her phone, because the services, the myInbox service, the
notification streams, the address book, those things are now available
on the Internet, so if you have connectivity to the network, and a
smart phone like this, you're dealing with one story. You don't have to
synchronize your mail from your PC to your phone before you go out, it
works that way you would expect that device to work for you.</p>

<p> Now, we're starting to get a bit deeper in, I want to talk about
open access and how we achieve open access is very simple, we take
these services, we define them at a protocol level, we have a contract
that says, if you send this SOAP envelope, this SOAP request for
service to a HailStorm service, and assuming you're authorized to make
that service, the user is willing to share that information with you
that you're requesting, or changing, or updating, or working with on
his behalf, then HailStorm will send a response, again, in the form of
a SOAP envelope. The data formats for the services are 100 percent pure
XML, they have schemas that back them, and that means applications can
work against these things just natively, and easily. And we've talked
about application end points, they can be anything from a laptop to a
flat panel on a refrigerator, to a Blackberry pager, anything that has
connectivity to the network can talk to HailStorm.</p>

<p> You can talk to HailStorm from any language, you can use our VS.NET
series, you can use PERL scripts, you can use Java, you can use
hardcore C, or you can write it in assembly language. It doesn't really
matter. Our contract is, you provide a SOAP envelope, you send it to a
service, we give you what you ask for and we give you the results back.
So it's very simply a compiler, a socket library, net access, and
you're talking to HailStorm.</p>

<p> So with that I'm going to show you some of that in action. The
first one I'm going to show you, this is&nbsp;--&nbsp;we took one of
the HailStorm services called myContacts, and we've got it running in
my office over in Red West, and all we're going to do is make very
simple queries against that service. So we're going to send a SOAP
envelope that says in that address book I'm looking for this name, and
dump out the information. This is a variant of a program called Finger
from back from the old days of UNIX, where the old Finger would read a
space-separated single line ASCII text file and do a search for the
name you're looking up and print it out pretty. Take that same model
and now we do it against a HailStorm store, so that the data is
available anywhere you go. And now instead of the data being space
separated it's XML data.</p>

<p> So I'm just going to do a simple call, looking up my name out of
this contacts database, and you probably can't see that, but what's
happening here is I'm running a PERL script that is looking for the
name Mark in the address book, and I can show you the PERL code if you
like. I mean the two lines in the middle, that's where we're sending
the SOAP envelope but it's standard PERL processing. That big long
chunk in the middle, that's the SOAP envelope that we're going to be
sending over to the HailStorm service SOAP. You know, in 30 lines of
code we're talking to HailStorm.</p>

<p> The next thing I want to show you is HailStorm running from some
other devices. First I'm going to start with the Palm, it's a little
bit slower because of the proxy, now it's really going to be slow. So
I'm going to make that same call, similar sort of envelope to the
HailStorm service, the Palm is a little bit slower. While that's
running, I'll do the same thing from a Pocket PC. There we go. I can
put other names, we're still waiting on this. I'm not trying to do
anything silly here. What happens with Palm is they're going through a
proxy at palm.net and the data formats are kind of wonky when you're
going through the proxy. So we'll come back to this.</p>

<p> Let's go to the Macintosh now. And again, we're running the same
application, and I'll try a different name in here. There we go. So
again, same sort of code running on the Mac. Let me see if this guy is
done. Yes, this guy is done. Why don't we go back to the Palm. And the
results that came back from the Palm, it said we had 52 bytes, Bill
Gates and his Web site came back, so there it is from the Palm and the
Pocket PC. And switch over to my other machine over here. Is Bill
around? Good. Okay. So this one right here is Sun OS. Sun OS 5.6 on a
SPARC 4 Ultra 510, and this one I'm going to run the Java version.</p>

<p>And I can get a verbose listing to show the SOAP envelope, if you
like. It&#8217;s a lot of XML is all it really looks like. And then let me go
back to this last one right here. This is Linux. I guess this is Red
Hat 6.2 or something. It&#8217;s Linux 2.2.1.14-5.0. (Laughter.) And just do
a quick lookup. You can barely see that, but it&#8217;s just the same simple
command that we&#8217;ve all been running for years, only now it&#8217;s going
against an address book hosted by HailStorm and we&#8217;re using XML instead
of space-separated values for the data.</p>

<p> So I guess what&#8217;s important about that is that for my team we had a
goal when we started out that HailStorm should be openly accessible. If
you can send SOAP to it, you ought to be able to play. Well, a lot of
times the difference between a goal and a requirement gets kind of
confusing and goals kind of drop off of product cycles over time. So
it&#8217;s not a goal for us; it&#8217;s a requirement. And the first thing that we
do when we get HailStorm up and running -- in fact, our very first call
came from a Pocket PC. But we take that as a requirement that any
device, anytime you have a compiler, network connectivity, socket
library, however you want to describe that, that device can make
HailStorm called, and that&#8217;s baked into our architecture and baked into
the way we think about this problem space.</p>

<p> So this slide I could probably spend a lot of time on, but one
thing you already see how any end point can call HailStorm. And you
might want to think that, "Oh, okay, I get it. All you have to do is
come up with some XML schema and that&#8217;s easy." Well, it&#8217;s not quite
that easy. There is some easy stuff in HailStorm and some hard stuff.
And this slide is all about the hard stuff.</p>

<p> We have a thing that we&#8217;re calling the "service fabric," which is
the glue that holds it, that makes this system possible. It&#8217;s a common
infrastructure that we&#8217;ve built that all these services to run under.
It&#8217;s a common way to name the services. It&#8217;s a common way to think
about the services. It&#8217;s a common set of interfaces that if you&#8217;re
writing a HailStorm service, that service must expose in order to have
uniform query across all the different services, to have uniform data
manipulation. So if I want to add a chunk of XML to a service, I don&#8217;t
have to learn a new way for Calendar versus an Address Book. It&#8217;s the
same add method. The data might be different. The schema for that
particular service might be different, but the programming model and
the service fabric and the glue that holds it all together is uniform.</p>

<p> We also have to obviously take these SOAP messages and
authenticate. We&#8217;ve talked a lot about putting the user in control.
Well, we need an authenticated identity so that we can put that user in
control so we can have a security model that says not only can we
identify who&#8217;s sending the message, but we have this thing called the
"sender chain," which is the user of the application and the software
environment that that call is coming from, so a user has a very rich
way of expressing who he&#8217;s willing to share his calendar data with.
Like he might be willing to share his calendar data with his mom, but
only when she&#8217;s running this application or that application or on this
kind of PC or that kind of PC. So all of that is baked into the
authentication model.</p>

<p> You know, XML looks pretty easy because everybody can read the
formats and kind of get it, but processing these messages in a uniform
way means you need to have a piece of code that you share between all
services that says, "Okay, yeah, that counts as a HailStorm service
request," or "Hey, this one&#8217;s missing a semicolon right here or it&#8217;s
slightly malformed, and we don&#8217;t want that to get into the system; it&#8217;s
a bad request. We need to turn that around." That&#8217;s part of the work
that the service fabric does.</p>

<p> You saw a lot about notifications today. Well, how do you route
notifications? How do we know when the notification comes in to ship it
to your PC or your pager? So there&#8217;s a bunch of information in the
service fabric that helps with that service routing and that preserves
bandwidth and makes these messages show up in the right place, prevents
spoof messages from entering the system in any way and prevents bad
messages from coming into the system.</p>

<p> Security is at the center of HailStorm. So before a message ever
makes it to the real service, myAddress or myInbox, the message has to
flow through a pipeline where any one of the stages can reject the
message. Our security system is part of this message architecture and
it looks at this authenticated identity, looks at the access control or
the sharing model that the user has expressed for that piece of data
and rejects or accepts the message. It&#8217;s a very simple binary decision
at the low level, but it&#8217;s complicated because of how richly we express
identity.</p>

<p> Operations: Well, you&#8217;ve got to be able to run these services and
what you&#8217;d like to have is a model that says, "When I roll out a new
service I don&#8217;t have to hire seven more people to run the service." So
the HailStorm service fabric is designed with the operations team
input, so there&#8217;s a common operational infrastructure that all
HailStorm services fit within. </p>

<p> We have to understand attacks on the system that can be intentional
or accidental. It&#8217;s hard to sort that out when a service feels like
it&#8217;s being overwhelmed with requests, so we have a common HailStorm
firewall that when the operations guys say, "Hey, something&#8217;s going
on," they have a way to throttle back the service, to hit the red
button on the service if they need to, to cut it off from a certain
domain or a certain network segment, whatever they have to do. The way
we get that is by building that logic into the service fabric. There&#8217;s
a dispatcher that takes these SOAP envelopes and says, "Oh, is it an
add, request or a delete or a send mail or a lookup calendar," so
that&#8217;s again part of this common service fabric.</p>

<p> And the key to all of this really is our XML shredder, the thing
that takes XML and can do rich queries that you normally associate with
a relational database. How do you do that on XML? That&#8217;s some code. We
call it our XML shredder, which just takes the XML document and maps it
into the various sequel roles and lets the rich query happen on the XML.</p>

<p>	So that&#8217;s a little bit of the guts of HailStorm, the part that I&#8217;ve been spending the most time on recently.</p>

<p>	With that, I want to introduce Bob Muglia, my boss and the group vice president of the .NET services group.</p>

<p>	<b>MR. MUGLIA:</b>  Great.  Thanks, Mark.</p>

<p> So Mark just got done talking about some of the technical aspects
of HailStorm, and what I want to do is take the next few minutes to
talk about some of the core principles from a business perspective and
the key issues that we know our customers will face.</p>

<p> And so let me start that discussion with an issue that I think
really goes to the heart and soul of what HailStorm is all about, and
that is a focus on the user and on the privacy of that information.</p>

<p> Now, there&#8217;s been an incredible raging debate in the industry on
privacy issues. We&#8217;re seeing legislation happening in Europe and lots
and lots of discussion even here in the United States on protecting
user privacy. And the core of this is as users use the Internet there&#8217;s
a lot of information they leave behind. And what&#8217;s appropriate? What
should be allowed for Web sites to do with that information? That&#8217;s
what the privacy debate is all about.</p>

<p> Well, with HailStorm and .NET in general, Microsoft is turning that
whole issue upside down, and we&#8217;re putting the emphasis and focus on
the user and saying that the information that the user has, the
information that the user is storing and retrieving and using together
with HailStorm, that information is there. It&#8217;s under their control.
They own it. They decide who to give it out to. Microsoft may run a
server, but we don&#8217;t own the data.</p>

<p> And so we&#8217;re making a commitment to the industry, a commitment to
users that that data belongs to the user and we won&#8217;t use it any way
that they haven&#8217;t authorized. We won&#8217;t mine the data. We won&#8217;t sell it.
We won&#8217;t publish it. And we won&#8217;t use HailStorm information to target
users with advertisements and banners and things like that.</p>

<p> Now, as information does need to get passed out, again the user is
in control and they choose when to do it. This model in the privacy
field is called "affirmative consent." They consent to what information
can be given out. And it&#8217;s frequently referred to as the "opt-in" model.</p>

<p> Now, just because HailStorm is focused on the user and the user
owning the data, that doesn&#8217;t mean that Web sites can&#8217;t build
advertising-based business models on top of this. They can amass data
as they think appropriate and the policies, the privacy policies for
any given Web site will still be determined by the company that runs
that Web site. But inasmuch as HailStorm information is used by that
Web site, it will be done on the permission and on the behalf of the
user.</p>

<p> And the idea of privacy and security go very closely together.
Information is released only at the user consent, and it&#8217;s ensured that
it&#8217;s kept secure for the user.</p>

<p> As Mark just described, there&#8217;s an entire architectural model
behind HailStorm that verifies and makes sure of the identity of a user
and that ensures the safety of the information that the user is storing
up there. We&#8217;re moving to industry standard protocols like Kerberos to
be able to provide a strong authentication mechanism, and setting up
mechanisms that make sure users have control of what information they
share with others, this idea of myDocuments. As documents and personal
information about the user goes up into the Internet, the user needs to
have mechanisms that they understand that allow them to control who has
access to that information; maybe their fellow coworkers, maybe their
friends, and who doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p> One of the challenges, one of the hard things that we always
struggle with is with security is how do you make it simple for users
to be able to work with this information. And that&#8217;s a challenge for
Microsoft and the whole industry to work together on.</p>

<p> HailStorm sets up some basic principles that will allow for that
management, but we have a lot of folks working in UI design across our
products and, of course, our partners who we&#8217;ll work together with to
build user interfaces that make it easy for users to understand how to
deal with these fairly complex policy issues. But by starting with this
idea of the user in control, we establish a brand new kind of model for
users in working with information on the Internet.</p>

<p> Now, another interesting and very important issue that we are
dealing with all the time is operating these systems and making sure
that we build an underlying data center and operational infrastructure
that allows these systems to be run with extremely high levels of
availability on behalf of the users.</p>

<p> And I&#8217;ll be honest and say that the idea of operational excellence
of running service systems is not something that Microsoft has always
had in the core of our genes. This is something that&#8217;s relatively new
to us, although we&#8217;ve been putting a significant amount of energy into
this and have been learning a lot really for at least the last five or
six years and have a pretty broad set of experiences with some very,
very large Web sites on the Internet, such as Microsoft.com and MSN, as
well as things like Hotmail.</p>

<p> Now, being honest, some of that experience is very good and some of
it&#8217;s not so good, but we&#8217;re committed to taking and learning from the
mistakes that we&#8217;ve made, such as the outage we had in January, to make
sure that we put in place the infrastructure so that we can run these
things with extremely high degrees of availability.</p>

<p> In fact, let me focus on this and say that in order for us to work
effectively with our partners, and, in fact, for us to begin to
transition our own software delivery model to delivering that software
through services, we have to move to have core services like Passport
operating at five 9s of availability. Five 9s, for people who have
heard the phrase perhaps, but aren&#8217;t familiar with the exact specific
meaning, five 9s means less than five minutes of down time per year. So
it really means a service that is really always up and available.</p>

<p> And the thing you realize when you start designing systems to try
and achieve that level of availability is that you have to work in a
pretty different way than you might in, say, a traditional data center.
You have to start thinking about it, as Mark mentioned, what levels of
access can come in and how you do authentication, how you verify that
the information, that the packet that&#8217;s coming in to you is, in fact, a
valid legitimate request and should be responded to.</p>

<p> You have to think about where you set up these data centers. And
because of the fact that natural catastrophes are possible and even in
that sort of a circumstance -- I mean, we had an earthquake here in
Seattle just a couple of weeks ago, and although all of the data
centers stayed up and kept running, you can easily image circumstances
where be it a natural catastrophe like an earthquake or just a backhoe
cutting through significant amounts of cables that lead into a data
center, that you need to have redundancy of that information in data
centers spread across the country, and, in fact, across the world to be
able to make sure that you have availability and that that user
information, particularly core things like Passport, can be accessed
from multiple places.</p>

<p> One of the things that&#8217;s very important about this is we have an
operations group inside Microsoft in my organization that&#8217;s really
focused on learning best practices and applying those across all of
these services. And as I say, you know, we may have made mistakes --
there&#8217;s no question about that -- but we know that this is critical to
our success. There is just no doubt that having Microsoft viewed as a
company that can provide operational excellence is critical to our
shift to software as a service, and we&#8217;re putting in place the
infrastructure and the team to make sure that that happens.</p>

<p>	Now what I&#8217;d like to do is talk about a very important issue, the issue of the Internet, of the business model.  </p>

<p> And with the meltdown of the dot-com space there is no question
that today&#8217;s Internet business model needs a reboot. As we move forward
into this next era, we look at the things that HailStorm is providing,
and underneath HailStorm is a set of technologies, it&#8217;s a set of
user-centric services. But if we just go out with the technology base,
we will not do the things that are necessary to help enable the
industry and create the kind of opportunity for businesses to thrive.</p>

<p> So while HailStorm is a bold new kind of services platform, it
brings with it a traditional, maybe old-fashioned or perhaps the right
word these days is a "retro" business model. </p>

<p> The business model, the core idea here, is that we think that
there&#8217;s value we can provide to end users in the services we&#8217;re
delivering, and we think that users will be willing to pay for those
services. And so this idea of subscriptions and having users pay
subscriptions to utilize these services is core to the business model
that Microsoft is putting forward with HailStorm and we&#8217;ll be using
across our product line.</p>

<p> But I think that more than that, the thing that goes with that is
it&#8217;s an opportunity for the entire industry to rethink their business
models. Everyone knows it needs to change, so how is it going to
change? And you look out there and you look at the services that are
being delivered to consumers on the Internet today, and there&#8217;s a lot
of value to those services. And as we move to a Web Services model,
where all of these things are tied together in a cohesive way, the
value to those consumers increases dramatically.</p>

<p> So we see an opportunity to help our partners, those who are
working with us on this Web Services mission, to shift their business
model to one that will be long-term profitable for them.</p>

<p> And will we succeed? Well, I firmly believe that users are willing
to pay for things that they get value from. We see it in example after
example. We pay for our cable or our satellite television. We pay for
our cell phone. You know, cell phones are pretty expensive things, but
I can&#8217;t imagine being without one. </p>

<p> So as we deliver valuable services on the Internet, we&#8217;re confident
that users will be willing to pay for this, and Microsoft will be
setting a leadership example by doing that with our HailStorm services.</p>

<p> Let&#8217;s talk about this in a little bit more detail. As I mentioned,
the core business proposition is value being delivered to the end user
and the end user paying for that value. And HailStorm provides a very
rich set of foundational services upon which this industry can be
created.</p>

<p> The key reason that value proposition exists is because the model
has shifted so that the user is in control of their information. They
can decide how they want to be notified, when, where their data is
stored, how it&#8217;s shared with others. And they get things like the
ability to access wide, wide amounts of the Internet with a single
sign-on through Passport. </p>

<p> And through this, this idea of building this business model, it
begins with Passport and it begins with creating a very large base of
users that are already provisioned with HailStorm services.</p>

<p> So what we will do is we&#8217;ll take the 160 million Passport accounts
that we have and as HailStorm services become available, we&#8217;ll
provision those accounts with the set of HailStorm services. And some
services, services that just make sense everywhere, like single
sign-on, those are things that expect to continue to provide to users. </p>

<p>And levels of this service, if users are using some small level of
these underlying services, we&#8217;ll provide those base levels of things
for free. But as the user begins to take more advantage of the
underlying services, as they take on more storage, and as we provide
features to end users that they see value with -- a great example is
the information agent that Bill talks about -- that a lot of great
ideas this company has on how we can take and put users in control of
their information and give them very rich ways to determine when to be
notified, what notifications to block out, where to be notified and
even profiling their behavior, understanding what they looked at last
time and what they threw away, all of those kinds of services are real
value add to end users and we expect to go ahead and charge users for
those sets of services.</p>

<p> Now, how will we make these things available? Well, we expect,
Microsoft expects to have a number of subscription services that we
roll out to our customers across our product line. Some of them are
things you&#8217;re probably familiar with, like Office and its transition to
a subscription service. Others will be news services, such as a
consumer focus subscription service.</p>

<p> And as we roll forward with these subscription services, we&#8217;ll work
together with government and partners, those companies that are out
there, those organizations that are out there, where it&#8217;s appropriate
for value to be added onto that and for them to resell those services.</p>

<p> Now in terms of the impact this will have on Microsoft revenue,
first of all, moving forward with Web Services and having Microsoft
take a leadership role in this transition is a very critical thing. We
think that&#8217;s important. And we think that it will really provide a
tremendous set of customer benefits to our existing products, products
like Windows and Office. And obviously those businesses are critical to
this company, so as those businesses transition to services we see the
ability for them to continue to grow and prosper in the coming years.</p>

<p> Now, we talked about this. This is not new news. I remember talking
about this exact same topic to many of you at Forum 2000 last year. But
as we&#8217;ve now described the technical implementations of HailStorm in
more depth, you get an understanding of how the technology can enable
the transition of the business models for our existing products,
products like Windows and Office.</p>

<p> Beyond that, we will have new consumer-oriented subscription
services that we&#8217;ll be rolling out over time. I don&#8217;t have any specific
dates to talk about right now today, but we are working actively on
those. And we see those as an opportunity, although perhaps I just want
to say this, to put it in perspective, we see it as a long-term
opportunity, something that will not affect this fiscal year certainly
or probably even next fiscal year&#8217;s results. But we do see it as being
something that will provide new revenue streams for Microsoft,
particularly since there&#8217;s so much upside potential to sell software to
consumers that is really still untapped.</p>

<p> All the details on this are still to be announced, and we&#8217;ll work
together with the industry to make sure that the right things happen
here, but I wanted to give you an idea of how this is a very important
aspect to our business model, again this focus on the end user.</p>

<p> Now, beyond the end user there are two other constituencies where
it&#8217;s important for us to have a close relationship. Those
constituencies are developers and service operators, those who run
production. And in the developer space, the tools that people can use
to write HailStorm services, write to HailStorm services exists both
from Microsoft and of course we&#8217;ll take Visual Studio and MSDN and make
those great tools for building HailStorm applications, but they can
also be as simple as a C compiler or a Perl script on another platform
to be able to access this.</p>

<p> We do expect to run a live test environment for our ISV community
to be able to test their applications and there will be a nominal fee
for them to use that service. And we will also provide those developers
with a local test environment, so that they can simulate running
applications within their corporation without going out on the Internet.</p>

<p> The developer model is pretty straightforward. It&#8217;s the same sort
of thing that you&#8217;ve seen from Microsoft in the past as we&#8217;ve worked
with developers to support our platforms.</p>

<p> Perhaps the more interesting relationship is the one with the
service operator, because here that relationship is a different kind of
relationship than what we&#8217;ve had before, because we have to work
closely with these folks, because they actually make calls against our
system. They put load on our system.</p>

<p> A simple example: You can imagine malicious issues and malicious
attacks, and those aren&#8217;t the ones that I&#8217;m thinking about here,
because we&#8217;ll be able to filter out most of those through having a
direct relationship with the people that are calling us. But let&#8217;s take
the case where we have a relationship, we have a relationship with the
product site and they&#8217;re using services against HailStorm and we&#8217;ve
actually issued them a certificate so we know exactly who they are and
this relationship has been established.</p>

<p> Now, you can imagine just a mistake being made by a developer and
instead of making one call to get a user&#8217;s name, they make 10,000 calls
every time. Those mistakes happen all the time, every day inside
product systems, but when they happen they affect a single part of the
environment. If one company has something go down because a programmer
has made a mistake, it generally has fairly limited affects on other
companies. But because this platform is a service and it runs in the
Internet, the ability to shield one company from problems that others
are causing is a critical thing. And again, in our expectations these
are accidents, but that accident can turn into a denial of service
attack.</p>

<p> So we will have a relationship with every company making calls
against our production system. We will have tools in place to monitor
the way those systems are being used. And if we detect that something
untoward is happening, we&#8217;ll have the ability to work directly with the
company that&#8217;s issuing those calls, the application that&#8217;s issuing
those calls and even shut it down for a temporary period of time if
that&#8217;s what is required.</p>

<p> We do expect that that relationship that we have will be a
licensing oriented relationship with companies that are running in
production. Our anticipation is we will charge a moderate amount to
those companies to have a basic relationship with Microsoft and to be
able to use these services. We&#8217;ll have additional relationships
available for people who have the need for a high level of service, a
high service level agreement from us, and perhaps need dedicated
on-site, on-call support people, or perhaps if they are putting
incredibly heavy loads on the system, they have a special purpose
application, we might have a special relationship with folks. But in
general the core principle here is that we&#8217;re not anticipating that
either the developer community or the service operators that utilize
these services are the ones that are really carrying the burden of the
cost.</p>

<p> The benefits accrue to the end user, and so it&#8217;s the end users that
are paying for the services. And our goal here in terms of establishing
these relationships with developers and service operators is to make
sure that it&#8217;s less expensive for them to use our services than it
would be to build things themselves. And I think that sort of speaks to
the key to this. There&#8217;s a lot of good reason for them to use a common,
centralized set of services and we don&#8217;t want them to think it&#8217;s too
costly to do so.</p>

<p> Now, another very important attribute of this is the way, the
process by which the specifications are evolving, and our work with the
community, the industry at large in those specifications.</p>

<p> So what we&#8217;ve done with HailStorm is we&#8217;ve defined an open process,
where Microsoft is working together in partnership with a wide variety
of ISVs today, and I think a broadening amount of software developers
in the future to define how HailStorm is built and how it can be
extended into the future.</p>

<p> The first sort of thing that&#8217;s important is that as new types of
applications or services are defined, new things that are outside the
core that Bill showed and Mark showed earlier, those specifications
will be created in partnership with the industry through an open
process.</p>

<p> Now, they&#8217;ll be supported by the core HailStorm services that
Microsoft&#8217;s running, things like Passport at the center of that, but
there will be an opportunity for others to participate in the
definition of those services and the running of those services as
appropriate.</p>

<p> And you can think of hundreds and hundreds of potential examples
where the industry at large can take what we&#8217;re doing with HailStorm
and extend that to different domains and different areas. We think that
sort of the thing that differentiates HailStorm -- Web services allow
any application to interoperate with another. The thing that pulls all
of these services together with HailStorm is this idea of having the
user, or the user credentials, at the center. So whenever you need to
identify a user, that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s important to have an open process in
place so that we can work together with the developer community, with
the industry to make sure that those services are extended in a way
that&#8217;s compatible with the HailStorm architecture and that doesn&#8217;t
introduce duplications and schemas that just make it confusing for the
end user.</p>

<p> Now, you know, as we&#8217;ve started talking to folks out there in the
industry, we just get lots and lots of ideas on sorts of things that
people might want to do. I have an example that I could just imagine my
daughter is on a swim team, and you can imagine mySportsResults, just
an example of something that&#8217;s important for a given community or a
given organization to have. There are so many different examples. Some
of them are individual in their focus at the consumer; others are much
more business oriented.</p>

<p> And one of the things you&#8217;ll see from Microsoft in the coming
months is working in process with the industry to define some sets of
services that are really targeted at more of the B2B scenarios. Most of
the scenarios we&#8217;re showing today are consumer focused. They go well,
well beyond the basic notification scenarios, but they&#8217;re consumer
focused. In the future we&#8217;ll have some B2B examples, as we work
together with the industry.</p>

<p> Now this process, this open process has already started. We&#8217;ve been
working with a number of developers since last year. We had a pretty
large design preview last week, where we had about 400 developers in.
And the reactions they have to both HailStorm and this process has been
very, very positive.</p>

<p> So the roadmap, where are we going with this? Well, right now for
developers we&#8217;re working on applications, working on services. Passport
is a service that&#8217;s available to them today to begin to take advantage
of. Later this year we will roll out a set of notification services,
pretty much in the same timeframe as Windows XP rolls out, that allow
the kinds of solutions, the kinds of prototypes that you saw today to
be developed by the industry.</p>

<p> Now, HailStorm, you can think about that in some ways those specs
that people are writing to as the .5 specifications to HailStorm. They
still have not been fully enabled with all of the HailStorm concepts.
And so working together with the industry, the team that Mark is
leading here has been defining this very complete specification and an
implementation behind it for how HailStorm works. We shared that with
the industry last week pretty broadly. In the second half of this year,
really in the Q4 timeframe, we anticipate going to a wide scale beta
with the developer community on the set of services that HailStorm
provides, and anticipate that next year in 2002 will be the timeframe
where HailStorm services go live on the Internet and people can begin
to use the actual interfaces that we define to build HailStorm-based
applications.</p>

<p> Now, obviously, Microsoft will be building services and taking our
products, transitioning those products and services, and taking
advantage of the HailStorm services. In a lot of senses, HailStorm
really is the blueprint for how those services will be built. It&#8217;s the
way that existing products, as well as new products can work as a
service. So you can expect that things like we already see examples
where sites like MSN take advantage of Passport very deeply, so our
service oriented sites are already on the path to this, but, you know,
we showed some examples of how Windows XP is a great end point for
HailStorm services. We see things like XBox being used for game
developers to hook up connections and communicate with each other. And
we expect that over time things like Office as well will leverage and
build on the HailStorm services to really talk and work with a broader
set of users.</p>

<p>	With that, what I&#8217;d like to do is invite Vic to come back up and show a couple more partner demos.  Thank you.</p>

<p>	<b>MR. GUNDOTRA:</b>  Okay.  Thanks, Bob.</p>

<p> We&#8217;ve got two more demonstrations to show you. The first one is a
very heavy-duty business example. And then we&#8217;ll follow that up with a
consumer example. And with that, I&#8217;d like to invite out the CEO of
Click Commerce Michael Ferro. Welcome, Michael; as well as Ben
Schwartz, who&#8217;s the senior developer. Michael, why don&#8217;t you show us
what you&#8217;ve got here?</p>

<b></b><p><b>	MR. FERRO:</b> Thanks, Vic. Sure. We at Click Commerce
supply channel management software to global 1,000 corporations to
enable them to collaborate with their training partners. As you can see
by our slide, we work on the sell side in helping corporations work
with their distributors who sell through dealers, who may go through
other resellers, to get the end independents and even to consumers.</p>

<p>	Now, this is quite complex.  And let&#8217;s kind of give you an example of how complex this is and how it has to do with HailStorm.</p>

<p> Let&#8217;s say, for example, an elevator manufacture and say this
elevator manufacturer has all these different distributors and dealers
and they really want to sell more parts, but they have over hundreds of
thousands of independent elevator repairmen out there who specify which
parts to use.</p>

<p> Now let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m Seth, an elevator repairman and I&#8217;m driving
around in my truck and all of a sudden I get paged. And everything here
that we&#8217;re showing you is live. And my pager buzzes and says, "There&#8217;s
been an earthquake in Seattle; a lot of elevators are out." In fact,
I&#8217;m giving a job report that says, "Go to the Hyatt in Bellevue and fix
it."</p>

<p> Now, what&#8217;s very important about this, Vic, is the way this
happens, was that the way we were notified, the notification service,
was that this elevator repairman was Passport enabled. And why it&#8217;s
important is that if I&#8217;m an elevator repairman guy who works for a
service center, he&#8217;s not going to have his computer set up and he needs
to be notified.</p>

<p> Now what it tells him to do is it not only tells him to go the
Hyatt, but then when he gets to the Hyatt to do the repair in the
elevator, he suddenly can go to MyElevatorParts.com -- that&#8217;s where
he&#8217;s directed to go do. </p>

<p> And why this is important is he can use his personal computer or
Windows CE device, and what you&#8217;re seeing now is that he&#8217;s using this
Click Commerce software. This is our channel management solution that
allows him to come in, and as you can see we know it&#8217;s him coming in --
this is also Passport enabled -- and that he can do everything from
looking at product catalogues to ordering things, and in fact since the
OEM is part of this, he can see the actual model number of that
elevator and pull up all the specs about it. In fact, he can find out
when he finds what the problem is, here&#8217;s the repairs and have hot
spotted microfiche to click on. And when he goes to order, since the
distributors and dealers are also collaboratively connected into this,
he can find out, "Oh, I need these types of parts," orders it, and what
happens here -- and this is really important -- is that he&#8217;s ordered
this in a way to say, "I need it now," and what&#8217;s done here, since we
have everybody connected together, we can check the inventories to find
out in a 50-mile radius are these parts available for Seth to install.
And in this case it says there&#8217;s only 20 of what he needs in a 50-mile
radius, should he even take this job, can he continue. And Seth
decides, yes, I&#8217;ll take these 20, let&#8217;s go. And once he presses "okay"
a lot of interesting things just happened here. </p>

<p> For Seth in the old days to have done this system, he would have
had to go to the site, try to figure out what the elevator is,
hopefully have books that he could go find, call up the office, go back
and forth and this could take days to figure out. But now this is
happening in minutes.</p>

<p> Now let&#8217;s say Seth goes on and repairs the elevator. Now, remember
he just punched in "okay." Well, suddenly about 30 minutes into fixing
the repairs he gets paged again. And when the pager shows up, what
happens now is it says, "parts are on the way, and by the way since
everybody else also has notification services, we&#8217;ve sent out messages
to the other dealers and distributors that they need to bring the rest
of that order to his location or to him as soon as possible."</p>

<p> Now, why we&#8217;re really excited about this value proposition is that
there&#8217;s three really huge value propositions with this HailStorm
initiative for our customers today. One is in just this one example of
an elevator manufacturer is that not just elevator manufacturers but 70
percent of all goods and services are sold through complex channels
that always ended up having hundreds of thousands of independents from
automotive to insurance at the end who need to get data and work
together in a collaborative manner. Well, what this did just in that
elevator example though is the parts the elevator company is selling,
they have 50 to 80 percent profit margins. If they can help enable and
make it easier to do business where these independents are specifying
their product, this is huge for them building their brand.</p>

<p> Also, when you put this collaborative commerce effort together and
incorporating some of the new Microsoft features of Passport, there&#8217;s
cost savings and increased efficiencies for all the partners and
distributors, the dealers, the resellers, and the contractors
themselves, not just the OEM. And so it&#8217;s a small business owner last
but not least this allows them -- this is kind of the last mile of B2B
when you put all this together -- suddenly he or she has the power to
build their organization tenfold, and suddenly they can do more jobs,
get more done, and they didn&#8217;t have to build any software
infrastructure. They&#8217;re not worried about IT. They&#8217;re only worried
about building their core business.</p>

<p> So right now we at Click Commerce are very excited and see a lot of
opportunity for this HailStorm initiative and the whole .NET initiative
to really help increase market share and brand for a lot of the global
1,000 of our clients today.</p>

<p>	Thank you.</p>

<b></b><p><b>	MR. GUNDOTRA:</b>  Great.  Thank you, Michael.</p>

<b></b><p><b>	MR. FERRO:</b>  Thank you, Vic.</p>

<b></b><p><b>	MR. GUNDOTRA:</b>  Okay, thanks, Ben.</p>

<p> All right, that was a great example of how these services can
really help business in a very, very deep way, not only in how they
interface to consumers, but how they interface with their own business
supply chain, really great. And you saw the notifications being
delivered on a non-PC device, on a pager, and that was great.</p>

<p> Now, I&#8217;m going to assume most of us probably don&#8217;t spend our days
going through marketplaces on the Web. Let&#8217;s switch to more of a
consumer example. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll all been on a plane. You probably
used a plane to get here. We&#8217;d like to invite up Suzi LeVine, marketing
director of Expedia. Welcome, Suzi, and Simon Tam, who is a director of
technology. Come on up. And Suzi, Simon, why don&#8217;t you tell us how
Expedia will utilize these services.</p>

<b></b><p><b>	MS. LEVINE:</b>  Excellent.  Thank you, Vic.  Thank you for having us here.</p>

<p> Well, as some of you may be familiar with Expedia, Expedia is an
online travel service -- air, car, hotel, packages, cruises, condos,
villas, et cetera, et cetera. But with $1.8 billion in sales over
calendar year 2000 we&#8217;re not only one of the top five e-commerce
businesses, but we&#8217;re actually one of the top ten travel agencies in
the US. </p>

<p> Now, I emphasize the word "travel agency," because of course that&#8217;s
our focus. And what we&#8217;re looking forward to with the .NET services is
their ability to help us be a better travel agency. For us it&#8217;s not
about deploying whizzy new features, although that&#8217;s an added side
benefit, it&#8217;s about providing a better experience for our travelers,
for our customers.</p>

<p> So what you&#8217;re going to see us demonstrate today is the utilization
of the Passport authentication, the Messenger notification, as well as
some of the HailStorm services like Buddies and Calendars.</p>

<p> Now, when you think of sort of your dream travel agent, or when we
ask our customers more importantly, and hopefully some of you are our
customers -- we ask them what is it that they really want from us, what
do they want us to deliver? And some of the things that can only be
delivered as a result of the .NET services and online are things, more
than what Bill was saying in terms of just flight status, but flight
status to the person picking you up at the airport. Or when we had the
earthquake a couple of weeks ago in Seattle, cell phone service was
completely crippled, but data messages were getting through, so
wouldn&#8217;t it have been great, if I had had a flight later in the day in
Seattle, to be notified that the air control tower had crumpled and
they were now working out of a trailer park?</p>

<p> So to give you a sense of how we plan on utilizing these services
with Expedia, we&#8217;re going to take a look at a real-time scenario. Simon
is going to take us through, he&#8217;s just working away on his PC. The
first thing you can see here is our utilization of the Messenger
extensions in Windows XP, deploying an Expedia tab in the instant
messenger client for that very perishable and dynamic information that
we know travel data to be.</p>

<p> So, for example, Simon sees a great fare from Seattle to San
Francisco where he can go and visit his mom, and he not only sees, but
then he hears her voice, "Come home, Simon," and he clicks on the fare
and he&#8217;ll get to a screen where he can actually go straight into
Expedia.</p>

<p> Now, if we were using the Windows XP unified logon, you would go
straight into the site, but what we want to show you here is the
ability to link your Passport account with your Expedia account. We
have a substantial number of people who have been using Expedia for a
long time. They have a lot of information. We want to make sure to
still accommodate the combination of the two. But people who are using
Passport to access Expedia will have a substantially better experience
because of some of the things that we&#8217;re going to show you.</p>

<p> So he&#8217;s going to sign in now using Passport and once he does that
we&#8217;re going to sort of fast forward through to the point where he&#8217;s
already booked his ticket on Expedia to go to San Francisco and see his
mom.</p>

<p> So he&#8217;s going to get to his itinerary, which hopefully some of you
will recognize from your own purchases -- if not, we can talk later.
And once you see that, you&#8217;re going to be able to get to the point
where we&#8217;re showing the utilization of the notification services, so
when we scroll down here, one of the new things is this "change
notification" setting. With that, Simon is going to click on the
notification settings and now just adapt his own notifications, but
adapt the notification to others from his buddy list. So he&#8217;s going to
visit his mom. Well, he has the capability to go in and let her know an
hour before the arrival of the flight that the status of the flight is
whatever it may be, and we&#8217;ll check that out a little bit later. He
also has the opportunity to let Bob, his assistant -- hey, Simon, we&#8217;re
trying to get to profitability; why do you have an assistant?</p>

<b></b><p><b>	MR. TAM:</b>  Hey, Suzi, someone has to integrate with these HailStorm services.  </p>

<p> Speaking of integration, now I want you to take a look closely here
at these "others" list. And if you notice, one of the things that we&#8217;ve
done, because of the ability for us to act on behalf of the traveler,
is that this list we&#8217;ve accessed programmatically via the HailStorm
services. So the list here that you see is exactly the same as the list
that we have here in our Windows Messenger client.</p>

<b></b><p><b>	MR. GUNDOTRA:</b> So that&#8217;s pretty profound. What you&#8217;ve
done is you&#8217;ve taken the data, which may have been locked up in a
particular application like the buddy list, and in fact you&#8217;ve freed
that through the HailStorm services, and you&#8217;ve deeply integrated that
into the travel experience?</p>

<b></b><p><b>	MR. TAM:</b>  That&#8217;s right, and at no time did I ever have to enter these same contacts at all into Expedia.</p>

<p>	<b>MR. GUNDOTRA:</b>  That&#8217;s great.  That&#8217;s great.</p>

<p>	<b>MS. LEVINE:</b> And through the utilization of the future
HailStorm services, such as Calendaring, you can also add it to their
calendar, so not only are they notified but they also are given a heads
up so that they can plan around their day.</p>

<p> So, for example, your mom, who might be shopping for her dinner for
you, your favorite pot roast, she&#8217;d be able to plan around that and do
the shopping in advance.</p>

<p> So you&#8217;ll click "continue" and you&#8217;re also going to set up your own
notification. Simon&#8217;s a little flight retentive, unlike most of us, and
he likes to be notified far in advance, as opposed to those of us who
kind of walk up as they&#8217;re closing the doors on our faces. He&#8217;s going
to click on the "update notification" settings and then the real work
begins in terms of Expedia goes out, Expedia as a travel agency goes
out and obtains the flight status at the designated time. Once we&#8217;ve
done that, then we&#8217;re able to send that information to the .NET
services and we don&#8217;t have to worry about where the recipient of that
information may be.</p>

<p> So, for example, Bob may be at his PC, Simon&#8217;s mom may be out
shopping with her cell phone, and we&#8217;ll be able to get those
notifications to the right person at the right time. See, we have the
little pop-ups in the right-hand corner there. So Bob&#8217;s gotten his
notification. So Simon&#8217;s mom has gotten her notification that, in fact,
the flight is running late. You&#8217;ll see that. There you go. The flight
is running late, the United Airlines flight. So she can know that she
has a little bit more time to add to the pot roast in order to build up
a whole stew for Simon. And overall have a better travel experience
within Expedia, as well as for friends of Expedia.</p>

<p> So let me just kind of recap what you&#8217;ve seen us utilizing in a
very real world scenario. We&#8217;ve been using the Passport authentication,
the Messenger notification, buddy lists integration -- how many more
"-ations" do I have here -- as well as the Calendar usage. And with
those services, again we&#8217;re able to focus on becoming an even better
travel service and provide the type of experience that has never
existed before online or offline utilizing .NET.</p>

<p>	Thank you.</p>

<b></b><p><b>	MR. GUNDOTRA:</b>  Thank you, Suzi.  Thank you, Simon.</p>

<p> Okay, hopefully you can see why we&#8217;re so excited about how even
these few set of services that are precursors to HailStorm really start
to enable a new user experience. We&#8217;ll turn it back to Bob.</p>

<b></b><p><b>	MR. MUGLIA:</b>  Great.  Thanks, Vic.</p>

<p> Well, let me just quickly close by talking a little bit about some
of the principles, reiterating some of the principles that we&#8217;ve talked
about today that have really guided the creation of this new HailStorm
platform.</p>

<p> The first one in many ways is the most important one, the
realization that this is on behalf of and for the user, and the user is
always in control of their information. They get to decide what to do
with that information. And by doing this, by really focusing on the
user, we enable a broad set of great new scenarios.</p>

<p> The second one is that this is about open access to any device, any
service, anywhere on the planet. We expect the PC to be playing a
super, super important role in this, but the PC is not the only device
that needs to work with these set of HailStorm services. So whether
it&#8217;s a cell phone, a PDA, a PC or whatever kind of device it is, on the
client side, and whatever kind of service it is on the back end. Of
course, Windows 2000 is supported and we&#8217;ll do some great things to
make it easier for developers to build solutions that work with
HailStorm, but if a developer is using Linux or if they&#8217;re using
Solaris as their back-end services, they can participate in HailStorm
as well.</p>

<p> The process of creating HailStorm to date and the process for
evolving it and moving forward is an open process. We&#8217;re doing it
together with the software development community. And we expect many of
the great ideas frankly to come from others in the industry.</p>

<p> There&#8217;s areas where Microsoft has expertise, but there are entire
industries where we really have no expertise, and we anticipate that by
working with others, new services can be added to HailStorm, which
really open up potentials that we have yet to dream of. In essence, the
extensibility of this is open and is based on whatever people would
like to do.</p>

<p> So to summarize, HailStorm is not just a new platform; it&#8217;s a new
breed of platform, a platform that lives in the Internet, that&#8217;s
focused on and delivering services on behalf of the end user. And by
focusing first and foremost on the end user we think we can transform
that user experience to one where the user is in control of their
information across devices and across services.</p>

<p> HailStorm is built because of and for developers. It&#8217;s a developer
platform, and it will be open for developers to call and use. It's
something that we expect to evolve into the future, and it's very, very
much focused on opening up and creating opportunities for developers,
as well as for the industry as a whole.</p>

<p> It's a technology announcement today. That's the number one thing,
we think that's the great technology, but we also view this as a shift
in business models for the Internet. As we move to Web services, the
business model can change, creating incredible opportunity for
everyone. I've been at Microsoft for 13 years, and we're just talking
about&nbsp;-- I was actually talking with Ray Ozzie earlier this
morning about how many of the people that are involved in building the
set of HailStorm services, this new platform, are old-timers at
Microsoft and we've worked together with the industry for a long time.
And I can say this for an absolute certainty, that it's been a long
time since we, those of us who have been putting this together, have
had this kind of excitement about the potential for how this can
transform the industry, and help people. I know that's why I'm here,
that's what I love about Microsoft, is that the technologies we build
have the ability to transform people's lives. And I very much see
HailStorm as one of those technologies.</p>

<p> We've a lot of work to do to actually pull this thing together.
It's a long task to actually get there, but it's a path we are on, and
we anticipate we really intend to finish in a big way.</p>

<p>	So, thank you very much.  </p>
